"Without analyzing anything, this game is enjoyable to play and it provides good practice with adding or subtracting 1 and 2. We could leave it at that. However, it is also a great example of two problem solving techniques that you can show to your child when they are ready: 1) learning from simpler examples, and 2) looking for patterns.\n"
"\n"
"Any of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position. Continuing in this way, build up a table of results:\n"

"This table makes it obvious that there is a repeating pattern of 3. When starting at 10, you should want to go first and subtract 1. What is satisfying about this is that, once you decide to look at simpler versions of the problem, the analysis is quick and easy - no tricky analysis needed. Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n"
"\n"
"But wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1."

"Why does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions."

"The fun thing about an investigation is that it invites a person to play with the numbers and be a mathematician. As mentioned above, play around with different groups of three numbers. After some experimentation, your child may notice that any group of three numbers that has at least one even number and one odd number behaves the same. However, if all the numbers are all odd numbers or all even numbers, then the sums are all even. Which brings up the usual question: Why does that happen?\n"

"After some experimentation, even a young child can stumble upon the beautiful number theory rule that says:\n"
"\n"
"* Even plus Even is Even\n"
"* Even plus Odd is Odd\n"
"* Odd plus Odd is Even\n"
"\n"
"Why does this rule work? Use the Number Shapes activity to represent even numbers and odd numbers with two rows of tokens - when will adding these numbers come out to two equal rows?\n"
"\n"
"Once this rule is discovered, your child may realize that the particular numbers do not matter so much. Having the numbers 1, 2, 3 is really no different from having the numbers 3, 4, 5 (or 3, 12, 17 for that matter). The analysis really depends on how many numbers are even and how many are odd.\n"

"* 3 Evens, 0 Odds - 3 Even sums\n"
"* 2 Evens, 1 Odd - 1 Even sum, 2 Odd sums\n"
"* 1 Even, 2 Odds - 1 Even sum, 2 Odd sums\n"
"* 0 Evens, 3 Odds - 3 Even sums\n"
"\n"
"4 Numbers:\n"
"\n"
"* 4 Evens, 0 Odds - 6 Even sums\n"
"* 3 Evens, 1 Odd - 3 Even sums, 3 Odd sums\n"
"* 2 Evens, 2 Odds - 2 Even sums, 4 Odd sums\n"
"* 1 Even, 3 Odds - 3 Even sums, 3 Odd sums\n"
"* 0 Evens, 4 Odds - 6 Even sums\n"
"\n"
"The results are surprising and leave many things to investigate if one is interested! What happens with 5 numbers, 6 numbers, or more? Why is it that interchanging Even numbers and Odd numbers does not seem to change the results? For example, if you have 3 Evens and 1 Odd you get the same results as 1 Even and 3 odds. For circumstances like 3 Evens and 1 Odd, why do the results come out balanced when the Even and Odd counts start out unbalanced?\n"

Then 1 would happen 10 / 18 of the time and 2 would happen 8 / 18 of the time. If you put both tokens on 1, you would need to get a 1 and then a 1 to win after two rolls. However, if you put a token on 1 and a token on 2, you would be successful after two rolls with a 1 and then a 2, or a 2 and then a 1 - something that is about 60% more likely to happen!\n"

Also, if you still have any of those puzzles, it is very easy to convert one of those puzzles to one of these. Take the following puzzle from Chapter 2. It involves counting from 0 to 6. The red numbers are the ones that would normally be left out when the puzzle is given to your child. To convert it to a puzzle that starts at 3 and skip counts by 2, simply multiply all the numbers by 2 and then add 3 to them (leaving out the red ones, of course)."

However, these puzzles can be explored more deeply, and here are some ideas to dig into if you or an older child are interested.\n"

However, the total of the three sides will also be the sum of all the numbers plus one extra copy for each corner of the triangle. Let C-SUM be the sum of the values in the three corners.

"Apply this to the triangle with six circles. The sum of all the numbers is the sum of the numbers from one to six, which is 21. So the equation becomes 3 x SUM = 21 + C-SUM The smallest C-SUM can be is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the largest it can be is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. So, 3 x SUM is between 21 + 6 = 27 and 21 + 15 = 36. This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n"
"\n"
"Another thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values. What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n"
"\n"
"The last thing to notice before we dig in with actual numbers is that for any solution for the three corners, we can assume that they are in increasing order going around clockwise, with the smallest number at the top. If they are not in that configuration to begin with, you can rotate or flip the diagram until they are.\n"
"\n"
"All these observations save a tremendous amount of work. We only need to look at SUM equal to 9 and 10, and we only need to have the corners in increasing order. If SUM is 9, then C-SUM = 3 x 9 - 21 = 6, so the trio is 1, 2, and 3. If SUM is 10, then a + b + c = 3 x 10 - 21 = 9. This leaves two possibilities - either corner values of 1, 2, and 6, or 1, 3, and 5. A quick trial rules out 1, 2, and 6 as a possibility.\n"

Taking a solution and subtracting all the entries from 10 gives the following SUM pairings: 17 - 23, 18 - 22, 19 - 21, and 20 - 20. So, solutions are only needed for 17, 18, 19, and 20.

"\n"
"a) Why are the numbers that drop down primes?\n"
"\n"
"Suppose you have a composite number. We want to show that this number will have an X under it. Being composite, it is divisible by some number, n, between 1 and that number. If n is a prime, then our composite number would have an X under it from n being an earlier prime. If n is not a prime, then it has an X under it from some earlier prime, call it p. Now, p evenly divides n and n evenly divides our new number, so p must divide our new number. Consequently, when marking the multiples of p, an X would have been placed under our new number.\n"
"\n"
"b) When you are placing X’s for the multiples of a prime, there are some numbers that already have an X from an earlier prime. When does that happen and when doesn’t it happen?\n"
"\n"
"Let’s look at the multiples of 5 in the sieve above. The multiples 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are already crossed out. Only 5 x 5 is new. This happens because 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are all multiples of 2 and 3, earlier primes. If we want to put X’s in fresh places, we must multiply 5 by numbers that only have prime factors that are 5 and above. Because it is a little tedious to keep track of all that, what some people do is only cross out odd multiples and leave it at that.\n"
"\n"
"c) For this sieve, what was the last prime that had a useful new X in its row?\n"
"\n"
"In this sieve, the primes with useful X’s are 2, 3, and 5. The multiples of 7 and 11 were all old X’s. If you look at the answer to the last question, you will see the answer here. The only way to get new X’s is to multiply a prime by primes bigger than or equal to itself. Once we reach a prime like 7 where 7 x 7 > 25, we do not need to check it. So, we only need to check primes whose square is smaller than or equal to the last number.\n"

If n is odd, a 4 by n table has n + 2 bounces and ends in the upper left corner.
