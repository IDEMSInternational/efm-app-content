  "Understanding the Game": "了解游戏",
  "Without analyzing anything, this game is enjoyable to play and it provides good practice with adding or subtracting 1 and 2. We could leave it at that. However, it is also a great example of two problem solving techniques that you can show to your child when they are ready: 1) learning from simpler examples, and 2) looking for patterns.\n\nAny of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position. Continuing in this way, build up a table of results:\n\n1W - 2W - 3L - 4W - 5W - 6L - 7W - 8W - 9L - 10W": "这款游戏无需进行任何分析，它本身就很有趣，而且您的孩子可以通过该游戏来练习1和2的加减法。除此之外，当您的孩子准备好时您可以通过这个例子展示两个解决问题的好技巧：1）从更简单的示例中学习， 2）寻找规律。\n\n该游戏的任何版本都可以通过这种方式进行学习。让我们看一个例子：从10开始做减法，得到0的人获得胜利。这个游戏的难点是10离0太远了。所以，让我们看一个更简单的版本。当要求孩子这样做时，他们通常建议从5或6开始（从1开始似乎是荒谬的，但这实际上是他们应该做的！）通常最好是尽可能从简单的开始（这意味着从1开始）。如果这是您先走并且计数为1，那么通过减1您就可以获胜。再试试别的数字。如果计数为2，您可以通过减2获胜。如果计数为3，那么您必输无疑，无论是减去1还是2，您都将对手置于必胜之地。如果计数为4，您将获胜。因为您将减去1，并将对手置于必败之地。以此类推，我们可以建立如下表格：\n\n1赢 - 2赢 - 3输 - 4赢 - 5赢 - 6输 - 7赢 - 8赢 - 9输 - 10赢",
  "This table makes it obvious that there is a repeating pattern of 3. When starting at 10, you should want to go first and subtract 1. What is satisfying about this is that, once you decide to look at simpler versions of the problem, the analysis is quick and easy - no tricky analysis needed. Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n\nBut wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1.": "从该表可以看出规律：每三个连续的数字对应的结果都是相同的。所以每当从10开始，您就应该先减去1。让人感到欣慰的是，无论问题多复杂，一旦您从问题的简单版本着手，您就可以轻松快捷地寻找到规律而无需进行复杂的分析。现在您已成为尼姆游戏大师了，从任何数量开始该您都知道该怎么做！这个基本游戏的任何版本都同样容易分析。\n\n那么现在问题来了：为什么重复的输赢规律是数以3计？一旦一个玩家被困在了“输”的数字（即是3的倍数）上，那么此后的每一回合两个玩家所减数字之和都可以是3。因为如果占下风的玩家减去1，则占上风的玩家可以减去2；如果占下风的玩家减去2，那么占上风的玩家可以减去1。这样一来占下风的玩家会一直被困在“输”的数字上。",

This circle drawing was made by moving ahead by one dot on one side of the line segment and ahead by two dots on the other side.": "在一个角的两侧分布着对应两组相同编号的点，通过连接两两相同编号的点就可以制作抽象的集合图形。您也许在作画的过程中根本不需要用到这些编号，如果是这样的话您可以将数字省略掉-这样就可以让设计看起来更加整洁。您可以通过让孩子用彩色绘画来让图案看起来更加丰富多彩。从网络上您可以在纱线画的类别中找到很多相关的例子。最右边这个圆形图案是通过在线段的一端连接一个点并在另一端连接两个点来实现的。",
  "Making Patterns With Circles": "用圆圈制作图案",
  "This is a special case of the last idea. Put some dots, say 8 or 9, evenly spaced on a circle. Your child can play with creating different patterns by connecting the dots in order, or connecting every second dot, or every third dot. To make it easier to do different experiments, use push pins in a piece of cardboard or wood and then use string between the push pins.\n\nIf your child is intrigued by the patterns that are produced, you can look at questions such as: For a circle with 8 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 3, 5, or 7, but 2 or 4 strings are needed for skipping 2, 4, or 6. Similarly, for a circle with 9 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, but 3 strings are needed for 3 and 6? It’s too young to understand the idea that 2, 4, and 6 have a factor in common with 8, and 3 and 6 have a factor in common in 9 - however, seeing the patterns may plant the seeds for later ideas.": "这是上面提到的最后一个方案的特例。将一定数量的点（比如说8或者9个）均匀地分布在一个圆上，然后让您的孩子按数字的顺序连接各个点，或者每隔一个或者两个点来连接。如果想让这个游戏进行地更加容易，您可以在一块纸板或木头上钉上图钉来代表各个点，然后用细线在图钉之间编织图案。\n\n如果您的孩子对他制作的图案感兴趣，不妨进一步去思考一下这些问题：对于一个有8个点的圆，为什么通过每跳1、3、5或7步的连接方法只需要用到一条线就可以把所有点连接满，然而如果是，每跳2、4或者6步则需要用到2条甚至6条线。类似地，对于一个有9个点的圆，为什么每跳1，2、4、5、7或8步连接只需要用到1条线，而对于3或者6步连接则需要用到3条。虽然对于小孩子来说它们还太小，大概难以理解2、4、6与8有共同的因数，而3、6和9有共同的因数——但是，这个游戏能给他们日后的思维方式埋下启蒙的种子。",

  "15-Sliding Puzzle": "15格拼图",
  "Puzzle Description": "拼图说明",
  "The classic version of this puzzle starts with a 4 x 4 empty grid of squares formed by 5 horizontal and vertical lines. Use a set of 15 pieces of paper the size of the grid squares, and number the pieces of paper from 1 to 15. The puzzle starts by having someone place the pieces of paper on the grid. The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty. To achieve this, a piece of paper can be moved if it is adjacent to the empty square - in which case it can be slid into that space. Depending on how the person sets up the puzzle, the puzzle may or may not be solvable.\n\nA 4 x 4 grid is too hard for a beginner, so start with something smaller. The grid could be as small as 2 x 2 or as big as the child wants. The number of numbered pieces of paper will always be one less than the size of the grid. For example, on a 2 x 3 grid use the cards from 1 to 5.": "这个游戏的经典版本以由5条水平和垂直线形成的4 x 4的正方形空网格开始。使用一组15张纸，其大小为网格正方形，并从1到15对纸进行编号。这个游戏的开始是有人将纸放在网格上。游戏的目的是在仅使网格的右下角为空的情况下使纸张有序。为此，如果一张纸与空的正方形相邻，则可以将其移动-在这种情况下，可以将其滑入该空间。取决于人如何设置拼图，拼图可能可以解决，也可能无法解决。\n\n4 x 4的网格对于初学者来说太难了，因此从较小的网格开始。网格可以小到2 x 2，也可以大到孩子想要的大小。编号的纸张数总是比网格的尺寸少一。例如，在2 x 3的网格上，使用从1到5的卡片。",
  "To create these puzzles, you have two options. The first is to place the squares randomly, in which case you have a 50 / 50 chance of the position being solvable. Alternatively, you can start by placing the pieces of paper in the final position and then making a series of legal moves to move the paper around. When you are all done, you are guaranteed that the puzzle is solvable.": "要设计这些拼图，您有两个选择。第一种是将正方形随机放置，在这种情况下，这个拼图有50%的几率是可解决的。另一种方法是，您可以先将纸张放置在最终完成的位置，然后随机按照游戏规则移动纸张。这样就可以保证拼图是可解决的。",
  "Solving the Puzzle": "进行游戏",
  "The main reason for a child to play with this puzzle is to have fun moving pieces around until they accidentally solve it and also to practice getting numbers in order. Despite that simple goal, you may start to wonder about deeper ideas in the puzzle.\n\nA frequent theme of problem solving is to learn from simpler problems or examples. So, let’s do that.\n\nThe smallest example is 2 by 2. For this size, it is clear that the rows will end up being either 1 2; 3 0 or 1 3; 2 0.\n\nThe next smallest is 2 by 3. Start this by getting the 1 and 4 in the left column. Once this is done, your puzzle will look like 1 _ _; 4 _ _ . Finish off the last four squares as you would the 2 by 2 case.\n\nThe 2 by 4 puzzle is done similarly. Start by putting 1 and 5 in the left column. Next, put the 2 and 6 in the second left column without disturbing the 1 and 4. Finally finish off the last 2 by 2.\n\nAt this point, the pattern for attacking puzzles with 2 rows is clear. What to do with more than 2 rows? Suppose you have 3 rows. Start the solution by getting the top row correctly laid out. After that, leave the top row undisturbed and use your ability to solve a puzzle with 2 rows.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 4 rows, do the top row first, the second row next (without disturbing the top row), and finish off the last 2 rows as before.": "让孩子玩这个游戏的一个主要原因是让他们乐在其中，直到他们不小心解决了问题，并且还可以从中练习按顺序排列数字。尽管目标很简单，但您可能会开始好奇这个的更深层的用意。\n\n解决问题的常见方法是从简单的问题或示例中学习。所以，让我们开始吧。\n\n最小的示例是2 x2。对于这种大小，很明显，行最终要么是1 2; 3 0，或者是1 3; 2 0\n\n第二小的是2x3。对于这个尺寸，可以先把1和4移到最左侧一列中。完成此操作后，您的拼图将看起来像1 _ _； 4 _ _。完成最后的四个正方形，就像处理2 x 2的情况一样。\n\n2 x 4拼图的处理方法与此类似。首先把1和5移到最左侧一列中。接下来，将2和6放在左侧第二列，而先不要管1和4。最后解决2 x2。\n\n目前为止我们已经清楚了如何解决2行拼图，那么超过2行的应该怎么办？比如说对于3行的拼图，您可以通过从正确排列第一行着手。之后，维持第一行现状，接下来的就和解决两行拼图一样了。\n\n同样，如果有4行，则先进行第一行，然后进行第二行（不影响第一行），然后再像以前一样完成最后两行。",
  "Is This Puzzle Solvable?": "这个拼图可以解决吗？",
  "Okay, you have a simple method for solving the puzzle. The next question is: How can I just look at the puzzle and know whether it is solvable or not?\n\nTo make describing the answer as simple as possible, do a few quick moves, if needed, to place the empty square in the bottom row. Next, make a list of the rows in one long list - the first row is listed first, the second row is listed second, and so on with the last row listed last. Omit the empty square when you list the last row.\n\nTake this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n\nAs an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n\nWhy does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions.": "很好，您现在已经掌握了一种简单的方法来解决拼图。那么下一个问题来了：我怎样才能看一下拼图就知道它是否可以解决呢？\n\n为了使答案的描述尽可能简单，如有必要，请快速执行一些操作，以将空白正方形放在底行中。接下来，在长列表中列出行的列表——第一行列在第一位，第二行列在第二行，依此类推，最后一行列在最后。当您列出最后一行时，请忽略空的正方形。\n\n拿这个长长的清单，计算其中的反转次数。当列表中较早的数字大于列表中较晚的数字时，这称为取反。如果求反数是偶数，那么这个游戏就可以解决。如果是奇数，则不是。\n\n以本讨论开始时的3 x 3拼图为例。首先将4移至第二行。然后，列表为：6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7。此列表中有10对数字是顺序颠倒的：6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, 和5 3。因为颠倒数字的对数是偶数，所以这个游戏是可以解决的。\n\n为什么该规则有效？我不会在这里进行详细的推论。关键思想是每次移动时都要留意颠倒数字的对数。事实证明，如果您把空格放到最后一行中，那么在进行任何一步移动之后，颠倒数字的对数始终以偶数变化。因此，如果颠倒数字的对数是奇数，那么这个拼图永远不可能按顺序排列。",

  "Another option for adding complexity to these puzzles is to use non-circular shapes.

Use matching shapes to practice adding twins, near twins, and halving. \n\nIf you like, you can add the rule that two non-circular shapes that have different shapes must have different values - for example, a square and a hexagon would have to have different values.\n\nMake any of these puzzles by starting with a diagram that is completely filled in and then removing some numbers. If the puzzle has some repeated numbers, use a square or other shape instead of a circle for that repeated number.\n\nThe next two puzzles illustrate the psychological difference between using a circle from two directions and replacing the circle with two squares.

Start with three cards and later on use more cards if your child enjoys the investigation.\n\nSuppose the numbers are 1, 2, and 3. The question is: If you randomly pick two cards and add them, are you more likely to get an even number or an odd number? \n\nThere are two ways to look into this. One way is to do experiments. Shuffle the cards, randomly pick two cards, and see whether the sum is even or odd. After each experiment, put a tick mark in the appropriate column on a piece of paper to count the even and odd results.\n\nThe second way is to count how many ways there are of getting an odd number versus an even number. For example, in the case of using 1, 2, and 3, there is one way to get an even number (1 + 3) and two ways to get an odd number (1 + 2, 2 + 3). So, for the numbers 1, 2, and 3, the odd number sums are twice as likely.\n\nAfter you’ve played around with 1, 2, and 3 for a while, try other groups of three cards. Does 2, 3, and 4 behave any differently? The groups 1, 3, 5 and 2, 4, 6 produce only even numbers - why is that? After playing around with three cards for a while, see what happens with 4 or more cards.\nTo make a game of it, let one player be Even and the other player be Odd. See who has the most successes after a dozen trial runs.": "使用一小组数字卡片，涉及一些小的数量。开始时使用三张卡片，如果您的孩子喜欢这个探究过程，可以稍后使用更多的卡片。\n\n假设数字是1、2和3。问题是：如果随机抽取两张卡片并将它们相加，得到偶数还是奇数的可能性更大？ \n\n有两种方法可以探究这个问题。一种方法是做实验。洗牌，随机抽取两张卡片，看看它们的和是偶数还是奇数。每次实验后，在纸上适当的列上做一个勾，以计算偶数和奇数的结果。\n\n第二种方法是计算获得奇数与偶数的方式数量。例如，在使用1、2和3的情况下，有一种方法可以得到偶数（1 + 3），而有两种方法可以得到奇数（1 + 2，2 + 3）。因此，对于数字1、2和3，奇数和的可能性是偶数和的两倍。 \n\n在用1、2和3玩了一段时间后，尝试其他三张卡片组合。2、3和4的表现是否有所不同？组合1、3、5和2、4、6只会产生偶数——这是为什么呢？在用三张卡片玩了一段时间后，看看用4张或更多卡片会发生什么。\n\n为了增加趣味，可以让一个玩家代表“偶数”，另一个玩家代表“奇数”。在进行十次试验后，看看谁的成功次数最多。",
  "Investigation Analysis": "调查分析",
  "The fun thing about an investigation is that it invites a person to play with the numbers and be a mathematician. As mentioned above, play around with different groups of three numbers. After some experimentation, your child may notice that any group of three numbers that has at least one even number and one odd number behaves the same. However, if all the numbers are all odd numbers or all even numbers, then the sums are all even. Which brings up the usual question: Why does that happen?\n\nAfter some experimentation, even a young child can stumble upon the beautiful number theory rule that says:\n\n* Even plus Even is Even\n* Even plus Odd is Odd\n* Odd plus Odd is Even\n\nWhy does this rule work? Use the Number Shapes activity to represent even numbers and odd numbers with two rows of tokens - when will adding these numbers come out to two equal rows?\n\nOnce this rule is discovered, your child may realize that the particular numbers do not matter so much. Having the numbers 1, 2, 3 is really no different from having the numbers 3, 4, 5 (or 3, 12, 17 for that matter). The analysis really depends on how many numbers are even and how many are odd.\n\nWith that in mind, here is a table of the possible outcomes for groups of size three and four.\n\n3 Numbers:\n\n* 3 Evens, 0 Odds - 3 Even sums\n* 2 Evens, 1 Odd - 1 Even sum, 2 Odd sums\n* 1 Even, 2 Odds - 1 Even sum, 2 Odd sums\n* 0 Evens, 3 Odds - 3 Even sums\n\n4 Numbers:\n\n* 4 Evens, 0 Odds - 6 Even sums\n* 3 Evens, 1 Odd - 3 Even sums, 3 Odd sums\n* 2 Evens, 2 Odds - 2 Even sums, 4 Odd sums\n* 1 Even, 3 Odds - 3 Even sums, 3 Odd sums\n* 0 Evens, 4 Odds - 6 Even sums\n\nThe results are surprising and leave many things to investigate if one is interested! What happens with 5 numbers, 6 numbers, or more? Why is it that interchanging Even numbers and Odd numbers does not seem to change the results? For example, if you have 3 Evens and 1 Odd you get the same results as 1 Even and 3 odds. For circumstances like 3 Evens and 1 Odd, why do the results come out balanced when the Even and Odd counts start out unbalanced?\n\nThis is some cool mathematics and even a small child can play around with it!": "调查的有趣之处在于，它鼓励人们与数字互动，扮演数学家的角色。如上所述，可以尝试不同的三数字组合。经过一些实验后，你的孩子可能会发现，任何包含至少一个偶数和一个奇数的三数字组合都会表现出相同的特性。然而，如果所有数字都是奇数或所有数字都是偶数，那么它们的和都是偶数。这就引出了一个常见的问题：为什么会这样呢？\n\n经过一些实验，即使是年幼的孩子也可能会偶然发现一个美妙的数字理论规则，该规则指出：\n\n* 偶数加偶数是偶数\n* 偶数加奇数是奇数\n* 奇数加奇数是偶数\n\n为什么这个规则有效呢？可以使用“数字形状”活动，用两排代币来表示偶数和奇数——什么时候相加后的数字会形成两排相等的代币呢？\n\n一旦发现了这个规则，你的孩子可能会意识到，具体的数字其实并没有那么重要。拥有 1、2、3 这些数字，与拥有 3、4、5（或 3、12、17）其实并没有什么不同。分析的关键实际上在于有多少个数字是偶数，有多少个数字是奇数。\n\n考虑到这一点，以下是三个和四个数字组合的可能结果表格。\n\n三个数字的组合：\n\n* 3 个偶数，0 个奇数：3个偶数和\n* 2 个偶数，1 个奇数：1 个偶数和，2 个奇数和\n* 1 个偶数，2 个奇数：1 个偶数和，2 个奇数和\n* 0 个偶数，3 个奇数：3个偶数和\n\n四个数字的组合：\n\n* 4 个偶数，0 个奇数：6 个偶数和\n* 3 个偶数，1 个奇数：3 个偶数和\n* 2 个偶数，2 个奇数：2 个偶数和，4 个奇数和\n* 1 个偶数，3 个奇数：3 个偶数和，3 个奇数和\n* 0 个偶数，4 个奇数：6个偶数和\n\n这些结果令人惊讶，并且如果有兴趣的话还有很多事情可以探究！例如，5 个数字、6 个数字或更多数字会有什么情况？为什么交换偶数和奇数似乎不会改变结果？例如，如果你有 3 个偶数和 1 个奇数，你得到的结果与 1 个偶数和 3 个奇数是一样的。在像 3 个偶数和 1 个奇数这样的情况下，为什么结果在偶数和奇数的数量不平衡时仍然是平衡的？\n\n这是一些有趣的数学问题，即使是小孩子也可以玩一玩！",

  "Game Description": "游戏描述",
  "In this game, use two dice or two sets of number cards going from 1 to 6. Each player has 6 tokens – animal tokens are perfect for this game if you have them. Each player also has a piece of paper with boxes numbered from 0 to 5. Each player decides where to put their 6 tokens – it is okay to put more than one token in a box. \n\nDuring a player’s turn, two numbers are created by rolling the dice or picking two cards, and the difference of those numbers is used. A player can free one of their tokens if they have one in that box. The first player to rescue all their tokens wins.": "在这个游戏中，使用两个骰子或两组数字卡片（从 1 到 6）。每个玩家有 6 个代币——如果你有动物代币，那是最合适的。每个玩家还有一张纸，上面有从 0 到 5 编号的方框。每个玩家决定将他们的 6 个代币放置在哪里——在一个方框中放置多个代币也是可以的。\n\n在玩家的回合中，通过掷骰子或抽取两张卡片生成两个数字，然后计算这两个数字的差值。如果玩家在对应的方框中有代币，他们可以解救其中一个代币。第一个解救出所有代币的玩家获胜。",
  "Strategy For Placing Tokens": "放置代币的策略",
  "How should a player place the 6 tokens? As is often a good idea, let’s start with a simpler question: Where would the best place be to put 1 token. This would clearly be in the box most likely to occur. Rather than doing any tricky analysis, we can simply list out the possibilities, count out how many times each difference occurs, and see which differences happen the most.\n\nCounting up the totals for the differences, we have 0 - 6, 1 - 10, 2 -  8, 3 - 6, 4 - 4, 5 - 2. So, 1 is clearly the best choice and it will happen 10 / 36 of the time. We can rank them in order of frequency as 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, and 5.\n\nThe much harder question is what to do with more than one token. Once you’ve seen these numbers, a good question for an older child is: why wouldn’t you just put all your tokens on 1? To see the answer to this, imagine the simpler situation where you had only two tokens and you ignored all results that weren’t 1 or 2. Then 1 would happen 10 / 18 of the time and 2 would happen 8 / 18 of the time. If you put both tokens on 1, you would need to get a 1 and then a 1 to win after two rolls. However, if you put a token on 1 and a token on 2, you would be successful after two rolls with a 1 and then a 2, or a 2 and then a 1 - something that is about 60% more likely to happen!\n\nRather than go into a long, detailed analysis, let’s just leave it at something fairly simple that appeals to our intuition - put most of your tokens on 1, the second most on 2, and maybe one on 0 or 3. There’s no guarantee you’ll win, but you should do pretty well in the long run!": "玩家应该如何放置这6个代币？通常来说，先从一个更简单的问题开始是个不错的主意：放置1个代币的最佳位置在哪里？显然，应该将代币放在最有可能出现的方框中。我们无需进行复杂的分析，只需列出所有可能性，看看哪些差值出现的频率最高。\n\n统计结果如下：0 - 6 次，1 - 10 次，2 - 8 次，3 - 6 次，4 - 4 次，5 - 2 次。所以，1 显然是最好的选择，它会在 36 次中出现 10 次。我们可以按出现频率将它们排序为：1、2、3、0、4 和 5。\n\n更难的问题是，当你有多个代币时该怎么办。看到这些数字后，一个适合大一点孩子的问题是：为什么不把所有代币都放在1上呢？为了理解这个问题的答案，设想一个更简单的情况，你只有两个代币，并且忽略所有不是1或2的结果。那么，1出现的概率是18次中的10次，而2出现的概率是18次中的8次。如果你把两个代币都放在1上，你需要两次掷骰子都得到1才能获胜。然而，如果你把一个代币放在1上，另一个代币放在2上，那么你可以在两次掷骰子后获得1和2，或2和1——这种情况发生的概率大约高出60%！\n\n与其进行长篇详细的分析，不如简单直观地说：将大部分代币放在1上，较多的放在2上，可能还可以在0或3上放一个。虽然不能保证你一定会赢，但从长远来看，这样的策略应该会表现不错！",

Start rolling a pair of dice. After each roll, move the token for the sum of the dice one square to the right. The goal for each token is to be the first to get all the way to the right across the page.\n\nLet your child come up with some questions to investigate. Some natural questions are:\n\n* Which token will win and why? \n* Which tokens do well and which ones do poorly? \n* Which token is the worst?\n* How will the winners change if the rows are changed to have fewer squares or more squares?\n\nHave your child explain their ideas about the answers to these questions, and then investigate their ideas by running experiments.\n\nAdd a competitive element to this by guessing which token will win before the round starts.": "制作一张有 12 行的纸张。每行放置 8 个方格。在最左侧的列中，在方格里写上从 1 到 12 的数字。将每个数字上放置一个代币。开始掷一对骰子。每次掷骰后，将与骰子点数之和对应的代币向右移动一个方格。每个代币的目标是第一个全部移动到页面最右端。\n\n让孩子自己提出一些要调查的问题。一些自然的问题可能包括：\n\n* 哪个代币会赢，为什么？\n* 哪些代币表现良好，哪些表现不佳？\n* 哪个代币表现最差？\n* 如果每行的方格数量减少或增加，获胜者会发生什么变化？\n\n让孩子解释他们对这些问题答案的想法，然后通过进行实验来验证这些想法。\n\n在每轮开始之前，增加一个竞争元素，猜测哪个代币会赢。",

In the example for 6, the odd spots are filled with 1, 2, 3, and the even spots are filled with 4, 6, 5 - the values 1, 3, 2 (the solution for a three-card deck) each increased by 3.\n\nThe pattern for an odd number of cards is a little trickier. As before, the odd spots are filled with the first roughly half of the numbers (1 to 4 in the case of 7). If you look at the examples, the first card after the arrow is going to be moved to the end, so it should be the card you want last in that sequence.

Ignoring mirror images will reduce the number of solutions to consider by half. \n\nFor example, we can assume that not only is the 6 in the bottom row, but it is either in the middle or the right side of the bottom row. Continuing that thinking with the 5, the bottom row can only have four possible layouts: 5 a 6, b 5 6, c 1 6, or d 6 1.\n\nAt this point it is a matter of working through the various possible values of a, b, c, and d.

  "Island Hopping – Compensation": "跳岛 - 补偿",
  "Using compensation for addition is a way to make addition problems much easier. The idea is to take an amount away from one of the numbers being added and give it to the other other number - the result stays the same, but one of the numbers becomes easier to work with. \n\nFor example, when you add 7 + 8, if you take 2 away from 7 and give it to the 8, the problem becomes 5 + 10. Alternatively, if you take 3 away from the 8 and give it to the 7, the problem becomes 10 + 5. Anytime you can make one of the numbers a multiple of 10, you will have a much simpler problem.\n\nThese puzzles provide practice in creating new problems using compensation. The challenge is to find a path that connects all the islands with the same answer. It is only legal to connect two islands if their problem’s numbers differ by 1. Only some of the islands will be on the path.\n\nMake these puzzles by starting with about ten islands with some connections. Identify a path from one edge of the islands to the other. Along that path, put problems that differ from each other by one - perhaps start with a problem that involves adding 10, and then make variations on it. In the islands near to the path, put problems with small changes that have different answers.": "使用补偿法来简化加法问题。这种方法的思路是从一个加数中取出一个数值并将其加到另一个加数上，这样结果保持不变，但其中一个数字变得更容易处理。\n\n例如，当你计算 7 + 8 时，如果你从 7 中取出 2 加到 8 上，问题就变成了 5 + 10。或者，你也可以从 8 中取出 3 加到 7 上，问题变成了 10 + 5。每当你能让其中一个数字成为 10 的倍数时，问题就会变得更简单。\n\n这些谜题提供了练习使用补偿法创建新问题的机会。挑战在于找到一条路径，连接所有具有相同答案的岛屿。只有当两个岛屿的问题数字相差 1 时，才可以连接它们。只有一些岛屿会在路径上。\n\n制作这些谜题时，从大约十个岛屿开始，设置一些连接。在这些岛屿的路径上，放置相差一个的加法问题——可以从一个涉及加 10 的问题开始，然后在此基础上做出变化。在靠近路径的岛屿上，设置一些有小变化且答案不同的问题。",

  "6-Circle Puzzle": "6个圆圈的谜题",
  "Apply this to the triangle with six circles. The sum of all the numbers is the sum of the numbers from one to six, which is 21. So the equation becomes 3 x SUM = 21 + C-SUM The smallest C-SUM can be is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the largest it can be is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. So, 3 x SUM is between 21 + 6 = 27 and 21 + 15 = 36. This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n\nAnother thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values. What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n\nThe last thing to notice before we dig in with actual numbers is that for any solution for the three corners, we can assume that they are in increasing order going around clockwise, with the smallest number at the top. If they are not in that configuration to begin with, you can rotate or flip the diagram until they are.\n\nAll these observations save a tremendous amount of work. We only need to look at SUM equal to 9 and 10, and we only need to have the corners in increasing order. If SUM is 9, then C-SUM = 3 x 9 - 21 = 6, so the trio is 1, 2, and 3. If SUM is 10, then a + b + c = 3 x 10 - 21 = 9. This leaves two possibilities - either corner values of 1, 2, and 6, or 1, 3, and 5. A quick trial rules out 1, 2, and 6 as a possibility.\n\nAfter much work, we have the solutions for SUM being 9 and 10 for the six circle puzzle. Remember that you can get the solutions for SUM being 11 and 12 by subtracting all the entries from 7.": "将其应用到六个圆圈的三角形中。所有数字的和是从1到6的总和，即21。所以方程变成3 × SUM = 21 + C-SUM。C-SUM的最小值是1 + 2 + 3 = 6，最大值是4 + 5 + 6 = 15。因此，3 × SUM在21 + 6 = 27和21 + 15 = 36之间。这使得SUM必须是9、10、11或12。还要注意C-SUM = 3 × SUM - 21，这对于找出角落的值很有用。\n\n另一个要注意的事情是可能值的对称性。造成这种对称性的原因是，对于每个解，存在一个通过将所有数字从7中减去（或对于九个圆圈的谜题，从10中减去）得到的另一个解。稍作计算将显示，这种对称性将一个和为SUM的谜题转换为一个和为(21 - SUM)的新的谜题（对于九个圆圈的谜题，则为40 - SUM）。\n\n在实际数字之前，最后一个要注意的是，对于三个角的任何解，我们可以假设它们按顺时针方向递增排列，最小的数字在顶部。如果它们最初不是这种配置，可以旋转或翻转图示，直到它们是。\n\n所有这些观察节省了大量工作。我们只需要查看SUM等于9和10的情况，并且只需要角落的数字按递增顺序排列。如果SUM是9，则C-SUM = 3 × 9 - 21 = 6，因此三角形的角是1、2和3。如果SUM是10，则a + b + c = 3 × 10 - 21 = 9。这留下两个可能性——角落值为1、2和6，或1、3和5。快速尝试排除了1、2和6作为可能性。\n\n经过大量工作，我们得到了六个圆圈的谜题中SUM为9和10的解。记住，你可以通过从7中减去所有条目来得到SUM为11和12的解。",
  "9-Circle Puzzle": "9 圆圈谜题",
  "Use the same approach for the 9 circle puzzle. The sum of the numbers from 1 to 9 is 45. Hence, 3 x SUM = 45 + C-SUM.

Taking a solution and subtracting all the entries from 10 gives the following SUM pairings: 17 - 23, 18 - 22, 19 - 21, and 20 - 20. So, solutions are only needed for 17, 18, 19, and 20.

  "In a magical garden there are two kinds of flowers. One has 4 petals and the other has 7 petals. A child was asked to pick some flowers so that the total number of petals was 13. Could it be done? How about 15 petals? For which numbers of petals is it possible? For numbers that are possible, can it be done in more than one way? For example, 32 petals is four 7’s and one 4, and it is also eight 4’s.\n\nBy trying many pairs of numbers, there are lots of examples to play with. For some pairs of numbers there comes a point where all numbers of petals are possible, and for other pairs of numbers there is no such point. For 4 and 7, every number from 18 on is possible.

Think of these numbers as 1 x 3 and 2 x 3. When you add these numbers together, you will always get some number of 3’s. There is no way to add 3’s and 6’s together to get 10, because 10 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nWhen 1 is the only number that evenly divides both numbers, there will always come a point where every number can be attained. For 4 and 7, that number is 18. To find that number, subtract 1 from each of the numbers in the pair and multiply those new numbers together. In this case, that gives 3 x 6 = 18. Another interesting facet of this situation is that exactly half of the numbers below 18 will be reachable.

  "Climbing Steps – How Many Ways?": "爬楼梯 – 有多少种方法",
  "Suppose your child likes to take steps two at a time sometimes, but one at a time other times. If your child wants to go up some steps, a natural question is: How many ways can this be done?\nFor example, for 0 steps there is just one way - you just stand there. For 1 step there is one way - you take a single step. For two steps, you can either take one double step or two single steps. \n\nYour child should carefully count many cases of this and make a table of the results. When there is lots of information, a table often helps organize the information and allow patterns to stand out. The table would look like this (okay, going beyond 6 may require too much patience, but here are the numbers):\n\n1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 21 - 34 - 55\n\nAfter looking at these numbers, your child may notice that each pair of consecutive numbers adds up to the next number. Why does this happen? These numbers are called Fibonacci Numbers. The rule for creating the official Fibonacci Numbers is that each number is the sum of the previous two. This also happens for the steps. Hmmm ...\n\nLet’s look closely at one example - say 5 steps. The 8 possibilities are: 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 2+2+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+2+2, and 2+1+2. The first 5 possibilities use 1 for the last move, and the last 3 possibilities use 2 for the last move. That explains it - you can go up 5 steps by either going up 4 steps and taking 1 more step, or by going up 3 steps and going up 2 more steps. The number of ways of going up 5 steps is exactly equal to the sum of the number of ways of going up 4 steps plus the number of ways of going up 3 steps.\n\nPatterns are often understood by patiently going through examples, organizing the data, looking closely at the data, and digging for explanations of why things happen the way they do. This is a good habit to develop in your child.": "假设你的孩子有时喜欢每次迈两步，有时又喜欢每次迈一步。如果你的孩子想要爬上几级台阶，一个自然的问题是：有多少种方法可以做到这一点？\n\n例如，对于0级台阶，只有一种方法——你就站在那里。对于1级台阶，有一种方法——你迈一步。对于2级台阶，你可以选择迈一步两次，或者迈一步一次加上再迈一步一次。 \n\n你的孩子应该仔细计算许多这种情况，并制作一个结果表。当信息量很大时，表格通常有助于组织信息并使模式显现出来。表格可能如下所示（虽然超过6级台阶可能需要过多耐心，但这里是这些数字）：\n\n1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 21 - 34 - 55\n\n观察这些数字后，你的孩子可能会注意到每对连续数字的和等于下一个数字。这是为什么呢？这些数字被称为斐波那契数。生成斐波那契数的规则是每个数字是前两个数字的和。对于台阶问题也是如此。嗯……\n\n让我们仔细看看一个例子——假设5级台阶。8种可能的方法是：1+1+1+1+1，1+1+2+1，1+2+1+1，2+1+1+1，2+2+1，1+1+1+2，1+2+2，和2+1+2。前5种可能性中，最后一步是1步，而最后3种可能性中，最后一步是2步。这就解释了：你可以通过先爬4级台阶再多爬1步，或者先爬3级台阶再多爬2步来爬5级台阶。爬5级台阶的方法数正好等于爬4级台阶的方法数加上爬3级台阶的方法数。\n\n通过耐心地举例、组织数据、仔细查看数据并挖掘为什么会这样，往往能理解模式。这是培养你孩子的一个好习惯。",
  "Balance Scale": "平衡秤",
  "A balance scale is a simple device for telling when two things have exactly the same weight. The scale is usually supplied with a set of weights that are used to measure the weight of other objects. There are many interesting investigations you can do if you restrict the weights you are allowed to use.\n\n**One Kind of Weight** Suppose you have lots of weights, but they are all the same - say, 5 units. Then the only things you can weigh exactly are objects that are a multiple of 5 (just like skip counting by 5).\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - One Side** Suppose you have lots of weights that are either 4 units or 7 units and you only use them on one side of the balance. The things you can weigh are the same numbers you found in the flower petal investigation. For 4 and 7, starting at 18 units you can weigh everything exactly. If the weights are 4 units and 6 units, you can only weigh even numbers starting with 4.\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - Both Sides** After doing the investigation with two kinds of weights on one side, your child might be surprised if you ask them to weigh a 3-unit item, or even a 1-unit item, with 4’s and 7’s. The trick is to put some weights on one side and other weights on the other side. For example, verify an item weighs 3 units by putting it with a 4-unit weight and see that it balances with a 7-unit weight. Similarly, verify an item weighs 1 unit by putting it with a 7-unit weight and see that it balances with two 4-unit weights.\n\nThere is an important math theorem called Bezout’s Theorem hidden in this investigation. Your child doesn’t need to know about that theorem at this point, but isn’t it cool that a young child can be playing around with advanced mathematics!\n\n**Doubling Weights** What happens if you have one weight each for each of the weights in the doubling progression 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16? How many ways can you weigh something that weighs 13? What is the largest weight you can measure? \n\nAfter some investigation, you will find that you can weigh everything up to one less than double the highest weight - in this case that is 31. Also, each item you can weigh can only be weighed in one way - for example, 13 = 1 + 4 + 8, and there is no other way to do it. Pretty cool! This situation is related to the binary number system.\n\nFibonacci Weights: What happens if the weights are in the Fibonacci Numbers? Is there more than one way to weigh some weights? Find a restriction that would cause there to be only one way for each weight.\n\nSuppose you have one each for the weights 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13. With this, 10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 + 8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 1 + 8. What is causing the duplication is that the Fibonacci rule creates more than one way to write the Fibonacci numbers in terms of themselves - for example, 2 = 1 + 1 and 8 = 5 + 3. The way to fix this problem is to insist that you cannot use two Fibonacci numbers that are neighbors of each other in the sequence. When you add that restriction, the only way to get 10 is 2 + 8.": "平衡秤是一种简单的设备，用于判断两个物体的重量是否完全相同。平衡秤通常配备一组重量，用于测量其他物体的重量。如果限制使用的重量种类，有许多有趣的研究可以进行。\n\n一种重量的情况： 假设你有很多重量，但它们都是相同的——比如说5单位。那么，你只能准确称量重量是5的倍数的物体（就像按5的倍数跳数一样）。\n\n两种重量 - 一侧： 假设你有很多重量，重量要么是4单位，要么是7单位，并且你只在平衡秤的一侧使用这些重量。你可以称量的物体重量与在花瓣调查中找到的数字相同。对于4和7，从18单位开始，你可以准确称量所有重量。如果重量是4单位和6单位，你只能称量从4开始的偶数。\n\n两种重量 - 两侧： 在用两种重量在平衡秤的一侧进行调查之后，如果你让孩子用4单位和7单位的重量来称量3单位或1单位的物品，他们可能会感到惊讶。诀窍是将一些重量放在一侧，其他重量放在另一侧。例如，可以通过将3单位物品与一个4单位的重量一起放置，并看到它与一个7单位的重量平衡，从而验证物品的重量是3单位。类似地，可以通过将1单位物品与一个7单位的重量一起放置，并看到它与两个4单位的重量平衡，从而验证物品的重量是1单位。\n\n这个调查隐藏了一个重要的数学定理，叫做贝祖定理（Bezout’s Theorem）。你的孩子目前不需要了解这个定理，但能用这种方式玩转高级数学是非常有趣的！\n\n加倍重量： 如果你有一个每个加倍进程的重量（1, 2, 4, 8, 16），会发生什么？如何称量一个13单位的物品？你能测量的最大重量是多少？\n\n经过一些调查，你会发现你可以称量所有重量，直到最大重量的两倍减去1——在这个例子中是31。同时，你可以称量的每个物品只能用一种方式称量。例如，13 = 1 + 4 + 8，没有其他方法。这非常酷！这种情况与二进制数字系统相关。\n\n斐波那契重量： 如果重量是斐波那契数会发生什么？是否有多种方法来称量某些重量？找出一个限制，使得每个重量只有一种称量方式。\n\n假设你有1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13这些斐波那契数的重量。用这些重量，10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 + 8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 1 + 8。造成重复的原因是斐波那契规则使得斐波那契数可以以不同的方式表示自己——例如，2 = 1 + 1 和 8 = 5 + 3。解决这个问题的方法是坚持不使用序列中相邻的两个斐波那契数。当你加上这个限制时，得到10的唯一方法是2 + 8。",

  "As usual, a good strategy for learning about this game is to look at a simpler version of the game, which in this case means starting with very small numbers. If it is your turn and you are faced with each of these numbers, here is what will happen: 1 - lose, 2 - win, 3 - lose, 4 - win, 5 - lose, 6 - win, 7 lose, and 8 win. By now the pattern is clear - if it is your move and you have an odd number, then you will lose; if you have an even number, then you will win.\n\nFinding the winning strategy is a big step, but let’s go deeper. Why does this work? What are the properties of odd and even numbers that create this situation? Set this question before your child and give them a lot of time to think about it and experiment with it - there is no hurry, and this process of wrestling with a question is invaluable and should not be short circuited.\n\nSome experimentation with small numbers quickly reveals what is going on. If you have an odd number, all of the divisors are odd, so when you subtract any divisor the result is an even number. Consequently, odd numbers on one turn always lead to an even number on the next turn. Even numbers always have both odd and even numbers for divisors. So, the situation is not quite the same. However, if you have an even number, your goal is to give your opponent an odd number, and there is an easy way to do that - select the divisor 1 and subtract it!": "像往常一样，了解这个游戏的一个好策略是查看游戏的简化版本，这在这种情况下意味着从非常小的数字开始。如果轮到你，而你面对这些数字，每个数字的结果如下：1 - 输，2 - 赢，3 - 输，4 - 赢，5 - 输，6 - 赢，7 - 输，8 - 赢。到这里，模式很清楚——如果轮到你且你有一个奇数，你将输；如果你有一个偶数，你将赢。\n\n找到获胜策略是一个重要的步骤，但让我们深入探讨一下。为什么会这样？是什么奇数和偶数的属性造成了这种情况？给你的孩子提出这个问题，并给他们足够的时间去思考和实验——不必着急，这个过程是非常宝贵的，不应该被缩短。\n\n通过对小数字的实验很快就能揭示出问题所在。如果你有一个奇数，所有的因子都是奇数，因此当你减去任何因子时，结果是一个偶数。因此，奇数在一轮中总是会导致下一轮出现偶数。偶数则有奇数和偶数因子。因此，情况有所不同。然而，如果你有一个偶数，你的目标是给对手一个奇数，而有一个简单的方法可以做到这一点——选择因子1并减去它！",

  "This simple process reveals some interesting facts about primes. See if your child can come up with some of these questions - however, if they don’t arise naturally, here are some questions to ask.\n\na) Why are the numbers that drop down primes?\n\nSuppose you have a composite number. We want to show that this number will have an X under it. Being composite, it is divisible by some number, n, between 1 and that number. If n is a prime, then our composite number would have an X under it from n being an earlier prime. If n is not a prime, then it has an X under it from some earlier prime, call it p. Now, p evenly divides n and n evenly divides our new number, so p must divide our new number. Consequently, when marking the multiples of p, an X would have been placed under our new number.\n\nb) When you are placing X’s for the multiples of a prime, there are some numbers that already have an X from an earlier prime. When does that happen and when doesn’t it happen?\n\nLet’s look at the multiples of 5 in the sieve above. The multiples 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are already crossed out. Only 5 x 5 is new. This happens because 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are all multiples of 2 and 3, earlier primes. If we want to put X’s in fresh places, we must multiply 5 by numbers that only have prime factors that are 5 and above. Because it is a little tedious to keep track of all that, what some people do is only cross out odd multiples and leave it at that.\n\nc) For this sieve, what was the last prime that had a useful new X in its row?\n\nIn this sieve, the primes with useful X’s are 2, 3, and 5. The multiples of 7 and 11 were all old X’s. If you look at the answer to the last question, you will see the answer here. The only way to get new X’s is to multiply a prime by primes bigger than or equal to itself. Once we reach a prime like 7 where 7 x 7 > 25, we do not need to check it. So, we only need to check primes whose square is smaller than or equal to the last number.\n\nd) If you were given a number, say 53, which primes would you need to divide it by to see that it is prime? \n\nFrom the answer to the last question, we only need to check primes whose square is less than or equal to 53. Those primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7 – none of these divides 53 evenly, so 53 must be prime!": "这个简单的过程揭示了一些有关质数的有趣事实。看看你的孩子是否能提出一些这些问题——不过，如果它们没有自然出现，以下是一些可以问的问题：\n\n1）为什么下拉的数字是质数？\n\n假设你有一个合成数。我们想要证明这个数字下面会有一个X。作为合成数，它可以被某个在1到该数字之间的数字n整除。如果n是质数，那么我们的合成数会有一个来自n的早期质数的X。如果n不是质数，那么它有一个来自某个早期质数的X，称之为p。现在，p可以整除n，而n可以整除我们的新数字，所以p必须能整除我们的新数字。因此，在标记p的倍数时，会在我们的新数字下放一个X。\n\n2）当你为质数的倍数放X时，有些数字已经有X是来自早期质数的。当这种情况发生时，何时不会发生？\n\n让我们来看一下上述筛选法中的5的倍数。倍数5 x 2、5 x 3和5 x 4已经被标记。只有5 x 5是新的。这是因为5 x 2、5 x 3和5 x 4都是2和3的倍数，2和3是早期质数。如果我们想要在新的位置放X，我们必须将5与只包含5及以上质数的数字相乘。因为跟踪所有这些有点繁琐，有些人只标记奇数倍数，其他的则保持不变。\n\n3）对于这个筛选法，最后一个在其行中产生有用新X的质数是什么？\n\n在这个筛选法中，产生有用X的质数是2、3和5。7和11的倍数都是旧的X。如果你查看上一个问题的答案，你会发现这里的答案。得到新的X的唯一方法是将一个质数与大于或等于它自身的质数相乘。一旦我们到达一个质数，例如7，其中7 x 7 > 25，我们就不需要再检查它。因此，我们只需要检查其平方小于或等于最后一个数字的质数。\n\n4）如果给定一个数字，例如53，你需要用哪些质数来判断它是否是质数？\n\n根据上一个问题的答案，我们只需要检查平方小于或等于53的质数。这些质数是2、3、5和7——这些质数都不能整除53，因此53必须是质数！",

  "Start by letting your child just play around with this and don’t be in a hurry discovering results. As you will see, this problem involves some sophisticated ideas for a young person. As needed, ask a question or two to give their thinking a little more structure. You know what’s coming – look at simpler tables first to look for patterns - when this idea becomes automatic for your child, this will serve them well for the rest of their lives!\n\nThe simplest tables are 1 by n, and they are easy to understand. Playing with a few values of n, the pattern emerges quickly. It is easy to undervalue a simple result like this; however, any completely understood result is to be celebrated, and this result will lead to others.\n\n**Result** 1 by n table: The ball will take n-1 bounces. The ball will end up in the bottom right corner if n is even and in the upper right corner if n is odd.\n\nThe next simplest tables are 2 by n. The patterns here are a little more involved. Good record keeping can make a big difference in something like this. An observant experimenter will notice that a 2 by 4 table behaves just like a 1 by 2 table, and a 2 by 6 table just like a 1 by 3. This quickly generalizes to the next result.\n\n**Result** A 2 by 2xn table behaves just like a 1 by n table.\n\nWhy is this? What is going on? This is a mathematical process to instill in your child – look for patterns and then seek to understand them, and with that new understanding extend your earlier results.\n\nWhat is going on is that the bounces on a table do not change if you enlarge both dimensions by the same factor. When that is done, the table is bigger but the geometry is the same. In geometry terms, the two tables are said to be “similar.” \n\n**Result** A kxm by kxn table behaves exactly like an m by n table.\n\nWe have gotten here in little steps, but this is a BIG result. It means we can start our analysis on any table by first removing any common factor.\n\nResuming where we left off for 2 by n tables. We understand what happens when n is even, but what happens when n is odd? What happens for 2 by n for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on? The pattern quickly becomes easy to see.\n\n**Result** When n is odd, a 2 by n table has n bounces and ends up in the upper left hand corner.\n\nLots of progress is being made.

You know what’s coming… Let’s see if we can explain why this conjecture should be true (or find out that it is false). \n\nAlthough there are other ways to understand this situation, as sometimes happens, what makes this problem much easier to understand is a new idea. It might not occur to you, but once you see it you will probably be amazed. The idea is to unfold the table so that the ball can go in a straight line! Here is what happens if we unfold the original 3 by 4 table and make the path of the ball into a straight line.": "假设 k 和 n 没有公因数。则 k×n的表格会有 k+n−2次反弹。如果 k 是偶数，则会结束在左上角；如果 k 是奇数且 n 是奇数，则会结束在右上角；如果 k 是奇数且 n 是偶数，则会结束在右下角。\n\n哇，如果这个猜想是正确的，那我们就完全解决了这个问题！你知道接下来会发生什么……让我们看看是否可以解释这个猜想为什么应该成立（或者发现它是错误的）。\n\n尽管有其他理解这种情况的方法，但有时使这个问题更容易理解的是一个新想法。你可能不会想到，但一旦你看到它，你会感到惊讶。这个想法是将桌子展开，以便球可以沿直线运动！以下是如果我们展开原始的 3x4 桌子，并将球的路径变成直线后发生的情况。",
  "Seeing that the conjecture is true is a lot easier now. The bounces correspond to crossing lines - there are (k - 1) of them to cross in one direction and (n - 1) of them to cross in the other direction, so together that makes a total of (k - 1) + (n - 1) = k + n - 2 lines to cross. Seeing which corner it ends up in is a matter of keeping track of how things unfold. We’re all done now with quite an interesting journey.": "现在看到这个猜想是正确的要容易得多。反弹对应于穿越线——在一个方向上有 (k - 1) 条线要穿越，在另一个方向上有 (n - 1) 条线要穿越，因此总共有 (k - 1) + (n - 1) = k + n - 2 条线要穿越。看到球最终停在哪个角落是追踪事物展开方式的问题。我们现在完成了这个相当有趣的旅程。",

Finding a way to exactly cover the chessboard with 32 of these 1 by 2 tiles is simple enough. \n\nLet’s start removing some squares from the chessboard and see what happens. If you remove one corner of the chessboard, you know immediately that you can no longer cover the chessboard with tiles because the tiles will always cover an even number of squares, and there are now 63 squares to cover. Okay, remove two corners to make an even number of remaining squares - can you cover it now? The answer depends on which two corners you remove. Why?

  "Let your child play with this before revealing the coloring idea. If they play around with small boards, they may discover the rule on their own, and that is always better.\n\nAn observation that helps a lot with this question is to use the coloring of the chessboard squares. If you take the 1 by 2 tiles and color one square white and the other black, you will see an interesting thing occur. Every tile must cover a square of each color. Not only will k tiles cover 2xk squares, but they will cover k white squares and k black squares - the same number of squares of each color. Using this idea, it becomes obvious that if you remove more squares of one color than another, it will be impossible to cover the board. \n\nIf your child is enjoying these questions, start branching out to using other shapes to fill the board. Play around with filling it with 1 by 3 tiles or with 3 squares in an L shape. What patterns and rules do you discover with these?

  "Filling Squares With Squares - Introduction": "填充正方形的正方形 - 介绍",
  "In which ways can you fill a square with other squares, where the other squares need not all be the same size? However, the lengths cannot be totally random numbers – the side length of each square must be some whole number multiple of a fixed length. The question to investigate is: What are all the numbers of squares that are possible? Also, if you know a number is possible, is there an easy way to describe how to do it?\n\nLet your child play with it over many days and don’t be in a hurry to get to the answer. There are many different ways to come up with ideas for this investigation, so be flexible and work with your child’s ideas. Here is a diagram showing how 6 is possible.": "如何用其他正方形填充一个正方形，其中这些正方形的大小不必完全相同？不过，正方形的边长不能是完全随机的数值——每个正方形的边长必须是固定长度的整数倍。需要研究的问题是：所有可能的正方形数量是什么？此外，如果你知道一个数字是可能的，是否有一种简单的方法来描述如何实现？\n\n让你的孩子在多天内进行尝试，不要急于找到答案。有很多不同的方法来提出这种调查的想法，因此要灵活并与孩子的想法一起工作。以下是一个展示如何实现6个正方形的图示。",
  "Coming up with some quick examples is always a good idea. Breaking the big square into squares of equal size as an easy start. From that you know that the square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …) all work. \n\nWorking off the 6 square example, we can use one large square of any size and put 1 by 1 squares on two of its sides. Doing that for ever larger squares (1 by 1, 2 by 2, 3 by 3, …) we get 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 5 = 6 (as pictured), 1 + 7 = 8, 1 + 9 = 10, and so on. So, all even numbers starting with 4 can be done this way.": "快速得出一些例子总是个好主意。可以先把大正方形分解成相同大小的正方形作为一个简单的开始。由此你可以知道平方数（1、4、9、16、25、……）都是可行的。\n\n基于6个正方形的例子，我们可以使用任意大小的一个大正方形，并在它的两个边上放置1x1的正方形。这样对越来越大的正方形（1x1, 2x2, 3x3等）进行操作，我们得到1+3=4，1+5=6（如图所示），1+7=8，1+9=10，依此类推。所以，从4开始的所有偶数都可以用这种方式完成。",
  "A powerful idea that wraps this up quickly is to see that we can take a diagram that works, and replace one of its squares by another diagram that works. So for example, if you take a simple 2 by 2 filled in with 4 1 by 1 squares, and you replace one of those 1 by 1 squares with the 6-square example, you get the diagram shown at right with 9 squares.\n\nBecause one square is getting replaced by an n-square diagram, the net change in the number of squares is to add n-1 of them. That means that we can take one number that works, and add multiples of one less than it to any other number that works. In particular, we can add multiples of 4 -1 = 3 to any other number that works - the easy ones to add 3 to are all the even numbers starting with 4. \n\nPutting that all together says that the numbers 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, … all work, and it is easy to see at least one simple way to construct them. It is also easy to convince yourself that 2, 3, and 5 are impossible.\n\nIf your child enjoys exploring that question, explore variations on this theme. Suppose you only allow squares of certain sizes - such as 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and 3 by 3. Or perhaps only allow 2 by 2 and 3 by 3. See which questions lead to interesting results and which ones are not so interesting.\n\nAnother direction to look at is filling other figures with figures that have the same shape. For example, ask the same question for regular triangles (triangles with all their sides the same length). Some figures are interesting to investigate in this way, and some are not interesting at all - which ones?": "一个强大的想法可以迅速解决这个问题，那就是我们可以将一个可行的图形中的一个正方形替换为另一个可行的图形。例如，如果你取一个简单的2x2正方形，并用4个1x1的正方形填充它，然后将其中一个1x1的正方形替换为6个正方形的例子，你会得到如右图所示的包含9个正方形的图形。\n\n由于一个正方形被一个包含n个正方形的图形替换，正方形的总数发生的变化就是增加了n-1个。这意味着我们可以取一个可行的数字，并将比它小1的倍数加到任何其他可行的数字上。特别是，我们可以将4-1=3的倍数加到任何其他可行的数字上——最容易加上3的是从4开始的所有偶数。\n\n综合来看，数字1、4、6、7、8、9……都是可行的，并且至少有一种简单的方法可以构建它们。而且，你很容易发现2、3和5是不可能的。\n\n如果你的孩子喜欢探索这个问题，可以尝试在这个主题上进行一些变化。假设你只能使用特定大小的正方形，比如1x1、2x2和3x3。或者只允许使用2x2和3x3。看看哪些问题会导致有趣的结果，哪些问题则不那么有趣。\n\n另一个可以探索的方向是用相同形状的图形填充其他图形。例如，可以对正三角形（所有边长相等的三角形）提出同样的问题。有些图形在这方面的研究很有趣，而有些则一点也不有趣——哪些图形呢？",

  "This is the first time in the story the baker has asked for payment for his smells rather than for his baked goods. Imagine how silly it would be if he had a sign in his shop that listed costs for different smells.": "这是故事中面包师第一次要求为他的香味而不是他烤的食物付费。试想一下，如果他的店里有一块各种香味的价格标示牌，那将是多么荒谬。",
  "Smells can be wonderful and delightful and can fill us with happiness. However, what are they worth? How much do you think a good smell is worth?": "香味可以美妙而令人愉悦，得我们充满幸福感。然而，该怎么衡量它们的价值呢？你认为一种好的香味值多少钱？",

  "How do you think this story is going to end?": "你认为这个故事会如何结束？",
  "\"Only two rands,\" stammered Ma Shange. \"Well,\" said the judge, \"hand it to me, please.\" Meekly, Ma Shange reached into the pocket of her tatty old cardigan and pulled out two one rand coins. She handed them to the judge. He took them, thanking her politely.": "“只有……两兰特。”玛珊戈结结巴巴地答道。“好吧，”法官说“请把它交给我。”玛珊戈温顺地从破旧羊毛衫的口袋里掏出两枚1兰特硬币，给法官。法官接过后，礼貌地向她道谢。",

  "Then he shook the coins in his big fist, so that they made a clinking sound. \"This is my judgement,\" he said to the baker. \"The punishment must fit the crime. Therefore the sound of Ma Shange's money is the payment you will get for the smells she stole. And now I wish you a good day.\" The baker looked thoughtful. Then, realizing how unreasonable he had been, he turned slowly and walked out of the room.": "随后法官摇晃着他的大拳头，发出叮叮当当的声响。“这就是我的判决，”他对面包师说，“惩罚必须与罪行相称。因此，玛珊戈的钱的声音就是对你被她偷走香味的补偿。好了，祝你今天快乐。”面包师若有所思地看了看，之后意识到了自己的无理取闹，慢慢转身走出了房间。",

  "What else, if anything, do you think the baker should do for Ma Shange?": "如有可能，你认为面包师还应该为玛珊戈做些什么？",

  "Your child will be learning many things in the coming months beyond counting to 10 and above.\nHere is a quick list of topics that will be covered in this Stage.\n\n• Counting forward and backward to 10. Don’t ignore backward counting – it is important for understanding number relationships as well as being an aid for subtraction.\n• Include 0 in your counting sometimes. Including 0 now makes it a familiar number and keeps it from feeling exotic.\n• Reasoning with properties and numbers. Understanding properties and reasoning with them is a key part of developing mathematical ability.\n• Deepening understanding of shapes, especially circles, triangles, and squares. Keep using descriptive shape names as your child interacts with them.\n• Comparing and ordering numbers.

  "**The challenge:** The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty. To achieve this, a piece of paper can be moved if it is adjacent to the empty square - in which case it can be slid into that space. Depending on how the person sets up the puzzle, the puzzle may or may not be solvable.\n\n**How to create:** To create these puzzles, you have two options. The first is to place the squares randomly, in which case you have a 50 / 50 chance of the position being solvable. Alternatively, you can start by placing the pieces of paper in the final position and then making a series of legal moves to move the paper around. When you are all done, you are guaranteed that the puzzle is solvable.": "**挑战:** 谜题的目标是通过移动纸片使它们按顺序排列，只有右下角的方块保持空白。要实现这一目标，如果某张纸片与空方块相邻，可以将其滑动到空方块的位置。根据摆放纸片的方式，谜题可能是可解的，也可能不可解。\n\n**如何创建游戏:** 创建这些谜题有两种方法。第一种是随机摆放纸片，这样有50\\%的几率谜题是可解的。另一种方法是从最终位置开始摆放纸片，然后进行一系列合法的移动来打乱它们。这样一来，你就可以确保谜题是可解的。",

  "**Where You've Been**\n\nYour child counts up and down between 0 and 10 and understands what those quantities mean. Early addition and subtraction skills are developing. An important foundation for those skills is confidence with adding and subtracting 1 and 2 with small numbers. Your child understands small quantities, and reasons with those quantities to do addition and subtraction for small numbers.\n\nIn addition to that wonderful stuff, your child reasons so much better now! They understand that objects and numbers have properties, and they can reason and do beginning problem solving. Your child is now a full member in family math games and puzzles and exploring the mathematical world around them": "**序言**\n\n您的孩子已经能够顺利地数0-10的数字了，并且理解这些数值所代表的具体数量。他们已经开始掌握一些基础加减法技能。这些技能的重要基础是能够自信地用较小的数字进行加减1和2的运算。您的孩子能够理解较小的数量，并用这些数量进行加减运算。\n\n更棒的是，您的孩子的逻辑思维能力得到了很大的提升！他们开始明白物体和数字都有它们自己的属性，并且能够使用这些属性来进行基本的逻辑推理和解决问题。现在，您的孩子已经能够完全参与到家庭的数学游戏和智力游戏中，探索他们周围的数学世界了。",
  "* Counting On – Count upward starting at any number, rather than always starting at 1. This is useful for addition and for finding differences.\n* Counting Down – This refers to counting downward starting at any number. It is useful for subtracting, as well as for developing a sense for the relationships between numbers.\n* Number Bonds – These are all pairs of numbers that add up to a specific number.\n* Ten Frames – Represent a number from 0 to 10 as that number of dots inside a 2 by 5 rectangular grid. For numbers greater than 4, the upper group of 5 squares is always filled.\n* Expanded Form – This refers to writing a multi-digit number broken down into the contribution of each of its digits. For example: 25 = 20 + 5 and 317 = 300 + 10 + 7.\n* Fact Families – This refers to a group of closely related math facts. For example, 2 + 5 = 7 is in the same family as 7 - 2 = 5 and 7 - 5 = 2.\n* Adding twins and near twins – An adding twin is adding a number to itself, such as 4 + 4. A near twin is one away from a twin, such as 4 + 5.\n* Doubling, multiplying by two, and halving, two equal parts, dividing in two – Children usu-\nally enjoy adding twins. With that comes the idea of doubling and multiplying by 2. Also\nassociated with that is halving, splitting something into two equal parts, and dividing by two.\n* Even and Odd numbers – Even numbers can be split into two equal parts. Odd numbers have one left over when split into two equal parts. Even numbers are the results of adding twins.\n* Skip counting by 2’s – Count up or down by 2’s – such as, 0, 2, 4, 6 or 13, 11, 9, 7.": "* 数字组合 – 所有加起来等于特定数字的一对数字。\n* 十格图 – 在一个2*5的矩形网格图上用点数表示0到10的数字。对于大于4的数字，上面一排的5个格子总是被填满的。\n* 扩展式 – 指把一个多位数字拆分，展示出每一位数值各自代表的意义。 例：25 = 20 + 5 ， 317 = 300 + 10 + 7.\n* 数字家庭 – 指一些关系密切的数学事实。比如说，2 + 5 = 7，就和7 - 2 = 5，以及7- 5 = 2 都属于同一个数字家庭。\n* 加同数与几乎同数 – 加同数就是一个数加上它自己，比如4 + 4。几乎同数是指比加同数多1或少1，比如4 + 5。\n* 加倍，乘以2和除以2（对半分） – 孩子们通常喜欢加同数的游戏。这就引入了加倍和乘以2的概念。同样，还有对半分，即把某样东西平均分成两部分，也就是除以2。\n* 偶数和奇数 – 偶数可以平分为两等份。奇数在平分为两等份时会多出一个。偶数是同数相加的结果。\n* 以2为单位跳数 – 以2为单位往前或往后跳数，如0, 2, 4, 6或13, 11, 9, 7。",

They can compare two double-digit numbers, and they have a beginning sense of place value with 10’s and 1’s.\n\nAs their skip counting is improving, they are also developing skills with multiplying by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The idea of even and odd numbers now makes a lot more sense to them.\n\nExtend activities from earlier stages to these larger numbers: Stage 3: Shape Sums, Going Up Some More; Stage 4: War - Double Digit Add and Subtract, DiffTriangles and SumTriangles, Fix It, Island Hopping by 1’s and 10’s, Fill in the Blanks Comparison, Sum Square, and Addition Pyramid.": "**序言**\n\n您的孩子现在可以数到 100 了！他们可以轻松地进行一位数字加减法的心算，还可以从任意数字开始计数或跳数，这有利于他们今后做一位数与两位数的加减。他们可以比较两个两位数的大小，也初步认识了十位和个位数的位值。\n\n随着孩子跳数能力的提高，他们 2、3、4、5 和 10 乘数的技能也在逐渐提高。奇数和偶数的概念现在对他们来说更加清晰了。\n\n可以将之前章节的活动延伸到这些更大的数字上：第三章：形状求和，数字再往上增加；第四章：战争-两位数的加减法，差异三角与总和三角，更改错误，从数字 1 和 10 开始的跳岛，填空比较，求和正方形，以及加法金字塔。",

  "* Counting to 200 – Introduce the 100’s place by looking at the numbers from 100 to 200.\n* Skip Counting to 100 – This is not new, but it is an important skill to reinforce.\n* Expanded Form and Place Value – This is a foundational skill, so it will be reinforced further.\n* Double-digit Addition and Subtraction – Skip counting will help make this seem effortless.\n* All Single-digit Multiplication – It is time to fill in the missing gaps for 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n* Rectangle Area is Length x Width – This is an important idea in its own right. This fact will also provide many opportunities for fun games and puzzles involving multiplication and factoring.\n* Factoring – Your child will learn the beauty of how numbers break apart into factors. 1 is a unit. A number bigger than 1 only divisible by 1 and itself is prime. A number bigger than 1 that is not prime is composite. 3 **squared** is 3 × 3. 3 **cubed** is 3 × 3 × 3. And 3 raised to a power means to multiply 3 by itself that many times - for example, 3 to the fourth is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.\n* Factors, Divisors, and Multiples – 3 divides evenly into 12. That makes 3 a factor or divisor of 12, and 12 a multiple of 3. 3 is a common factor of 12 and 15, and 12 is a common multiple of 4 and 6.\n* Single-digit Division – Your child will learn division indirectly in the form of finding a missing factor in a multiplication problem.\n* Fact Families for Multiplication and Division – We'll reinforce the connection between these two operations. For example, 2 × 5 = 10, 5 × 2 = 10, 10 / 2 = 5, and 10 / 5 = 2 form a fact family.": "* 数到 200 – 通过观察 100 到 200 的数字来介绍 100 的位值。\n* 跳数到 100 – 这不是一个新知识，但它是一个重要的技能，需要不断练习。\n* 展开式和位值 – 这是一项基础技能，需要不断练习。\n* 两位数加减法 – 跳数可以帮我们轻松进行两位数的加减。\n* 一位数乘法 – 是时候学习 6、7、8 和 9 乘法了。\n* 矩形面积＝长×宽 – 这个本身就是一个重要的数学概念。这个知识点还能为很多有趣的游戏和涉及乘法与因式分解的谜题提供诀窍。\n* 因式分解 – 你的孩子将学习数字如何分解成因数的奇妙之处。1 是一个单位。大于 1 且仅能被 1 和自身整除的自然数是质数；大于 1 且不是质数的数是合数。3 的平方是 3 x 3。3 的立方是 3 x 3 x 3。3 的幂是指将 3 乘以自身很多次——例如，3 的四次方是 3 x 3 x 3 x 3。\n* 因数、约数和倍数 – 3 可以整除 12。这使得 3 成为 12 的因数或约数，而 12 是 3 的倍数。3 是 12 和 15 的公因数，而 12 是 4 和 6 的公倍数。\n* 一位数除法 – 你的孩子将通过在乘法问题中找出缺失的因数来间接学习除法。\n* 乘法和除法的运算族 – 我们将在该阶段加强这两种运算之间的联系。例如，2 x 5 = 10、5 x 2 = 10、10 ÷ 2 = 5 和 10 ÷ 5 = 2 构成了一个乘除法运算族（一组相关的数学算式，使用相同的数字，但运算不同）。",

  "**How to solve:** Start with the distinctive entries.\n\nThe 20 forces its row to be multiplying by 4, and then the 36 makes its column be 9.\n\nThe 49 forces its column and row to be multiplying by 7. The 9 forces its column and row to be multiplying by 3.": "**解决方法:** 从独特的数字开始推理。\n\n20 意味着它所在的行是由 4 乘出来的，而36所在的列是由 9 乘出来的。\n\n49 意味着它所在的列和行是由 7 乘出来的。9 意味着它所在的列和行是由 3 乘出来的。\n\t\t",
  "Continue the detective work in this way and fill in the entries as the headings are discovered.": "继续以这种方式推理，随着标题的确定，逐步填空表格。",
  "**Level of difficulty:** Increase or decrease the difficulty by leaving out more or less of the numbers. In this example, the '5' in the 5 column could have been left out – there must be a factor of 5 in 20, and that factor cannot come from 20's row because there is a 36 in that row.\n\n**Your child can make them:** Challenge your child to make one of these puzzles for you. A lot of good thought can go into creating one of these!": "**难度等级:** 通过省略更多或更少的数字来增加或降低难度。 在这个例子中，5 列中的 “5” 可以省略 - 20 中必须包含 5 的因数，而这个因数不可能来自 20 所在的行，因为该行中有 36。\n\n**让孩子自己制作:** 让孩子为你制作这样一个谜题吧！ 制作谜题需要思考很多。",

  "**Unit, prime, composite:** 1 is a unit, and can only be made with a 1 by 1 rectangle. The numbers, such as 5, that only have flat rectangles, are called primes. Numbers that are not a unit or a prime are called composite because they are composed of primes being multiplied together, such as 12 = 2 × 2 × 3.

  "A DEFINITION AND A RULE": "定义与规则",
  "**The definition:** Just as 4 × 2 is a quick way to write 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, so 2<sup>4</sup> is a quick way to write 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. It’s much easier to say and understand the phrase “two to the fourth,” than to say “two times two times ... “\n\n**Special names:** The second power, 4<sup>2</sup> for example, can be said **four squared,** and the third power, 4<sup>3</sup> for example, can be said **four cubed.**\n\n**The rule:** When powers of the same number are multiplied, a simple rule governs how to simplify the result – add the powers. For example, if you do 4<sup>2</sup> × 4<sup>3</sup> = (4 × 4) × (4 × 4 × 4) = 4<sup>5</sup>, we have two fours multiplied by three fours, so the result is five fours being multiplied.\n\n**Caution:** Note that this rule for adding exponents only works when it is the same number being taken to a power – you can't easily simplify 3<sup>2</sup> × 5<sup>3</sup>.": "**定义:** 就像 4 × 2 是 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 的简写一样，2<sup>4</sup> 是 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 的简写。 说出“2 的四次方”比重复地说“二乘二再乘二……”更容易理解和表达。 \n\n**特殊名称:** 二次方，例如 4<sup>2</sup>，可以称为四的平方，三次方，例如 4<sup>3</sup>，可以称为四的立方。\n\n**规则:** 相同数的幂相乘时，遵循一个简单的规则来简化结果 - 即指数相加。例如，计算 4<sup>2</sup> × 4<sup>3</sup> = (4 × 4) × (4 × 4 × 4) = 4<sup>5</sup>，我们有两个四乘以三个四，因此结果是五个四相乘。\n\n**注意:** 请注意，这个指数相加的规则只适用于同一数的幂次方。诸如 3<sup>2</sup> × 5<sup>3</sup> 的乘方运算并不能直接通过这种方式简化。",

  "**Simple example:** Start with the simplest mobiles, which are just levers in the air. Above is a solution for putting the weights from 1 to 4 on this mobile to balance it. This works because (2 × 4) + (1 × 2) = (4 × 1) + (3 × 2).\n\n**More complicated example:** Use the total of the weights below it to balance each side of the top wire (1 + 3) × 3 = (4 + 2) × 2.": "**简单示例:** 从最简单的平衡挂饰开始，它们就像悬空的杠杆。 以下是如何在这个平衡挂饰上放置 1 到 4 的配重使其平衡。 这是可行的，因为 2 x 4 + 1 x 2 = 4 x 1 + 3 x 2。\n\n**更复杂的示例:** 使用下方配重的总和来平衡顶部金属丝的两侧 (1 + 3) x 3 = (4 + 2) x 2。",

  "**The setup:** Suppose you have a calculator that is badly broken and you are challenged to produce some result on the calculator. This is easy to play orally whenever you have a spare moment. Here are some examples to get you started.\n\n**Example:** Suppose you had a calculator with +, -, ×, and /, but only one working number key, the 4. Could you get the result 21? If so, what is the fewest number of steps you would need? Suppose you could use 4 at most four times - which numbers could you produce? Suppose you had to use the 4 exactly four times. Play around with having other single keys and creating other results.": "**准备工作:** 假设你有一个坏了的计算器，你面临着在计算器上算出某个结果的挑战。 这是一个随时可以进行的口头游戏。 以下是一些入门示例。\n\n**示例:** 假设你的计算器只有加 (+)、减 (-)、乘 (x) 和除 (÷) 功能，但只有一个数字键 4 可以使用。你能算出 21 吗？ 如果可以，你需要最少的步骤是几步？假设你最多只能使用数字 4 四次，你能算出哪些数字。假设你必须使用数字 4 恰好四次又会有什么结果？尝试使用其他单个数字键并算出其他结果。",

Starting at 1, how many numbers can you create if you must use exactly four 4's in your work on the calculator?": "这些练习与我们之前在其他场景中看到的 (例如天平秤) 是一样的。\n\n假设你只有一个 1 键，只能加或翻倍。 例如，2 x (2 x 1) + 1 是 5。 你还能创造哪些数字？\n\n**示例:** 一个有趣的挑战是“四个4”的挑战。 假设你有一个只有一个 4 键的计算器，所有运算符都可以使用。从 1 开始，如果你必须在计算器上使用四个 4，你可以创建多少个数字？",
  "GRABBING FACTORS": "抓因数",
  "**The setup:** Use a board with a 4 by 6 grid of numbers from 1 to 24.\n\n**How to play:** On a turn, a player chooses a number that is uncovered and has at least one factor uncovered – the player gets the selected number and the other player gets any or all of the uncovered factors (their choice as to how many). Play alternates until there are no legal numbers left.\n\n**How to win:** The players add up their numbers and the higher sum wins.\n\n**Tax Collector solitaire:** This can also be played as a solitaire puzzle, called Tax Collector. The one player selects each number and the tax collector gets all the available factors. Play continues until the player no longer has a legal move. At that point, the tax collector receives the remaining numbers. The goal is to have as large a sum as possible – bigger than the tax collector when that’s possible.": "**准备工作:** 使用一个标有 1 到 24 的 4 x 6 数字方格的棋盘。\n\n**游戏规则:** 轮到玩家时，从没有被覆盖的数字中选择一个至少有一个未被覆盖的因数 - 玩家获得所选数字，另一位玩家可以获得任何或所有未被覆盖的因数 (可以自由选择数量)。轮流进行，直到没有可选择的数字为止。\n\n**获胜条件:** 玩家计算各自的数字总和，得分较高者获胜。\n\n**税收单人游戏:** 这也可以作为单人谜题玩，称为税收官。一个玩家选择每个数字，税收官得到所有可用的因数。继续玩，直到玩家没有合法的移动。此时，税收官得到剩余的数字。目标是尽可能大的总和——尽可能超过税收官。",

  "**The setup:** Players start the game by secretly picking 5 distinct numbers larger than 20 and less than 121. After all selections are made, they are written where all can see them.\n\n**How to play:** Using Number Cards or some other device, a random number from 1 to 20 is created. That number is repeatedly doubled until either someone’s number is hit for the first time or the number becomes bigger than 120.\n\n**How to win:** The first player to have all five numbers hit is the winner.": "**准备工作:** 玩家们先各自选取 5 个不同的数字，范围大于 20 且小于 121。 所有人选择完成后，将数字写在所有玩家都能看到的地方。\n\n**游戏规则:** 使用数字卡片或其他工具生成 1 到 20 的随机数。 这个数字会一直翻倍，直到某个玩家的数字首次被命中，或者这个数字变为大于 120。\n\n**获胜条件:** 首位五个数字都被命中的玩家获胜。",
  "Selection strategies": "选数策略",
  "It is a bad idea to pick a number, such as 46, that is not a power of 2 times some number between 1 and 20 – it will never get hit. Some numbers with lots of factors of 2, such as 32, are more likely to be hit because more starting numbers can get to them.": "选择诸如 46 之类的数字并不是一个好策略，因为 46 不是2的幂乘以1到20之间的某个数字 - 它永远不会被命中。一些有许多 2 的因子的数字，例如 32，更容易被命中，因为更多的起始数字可以到达它们。",

  "Factors Count": "因数个数",
  "**The setup:** Have two sets of cards, say from 1 to 25.\n\n**How to play:** Play the standard game of war with these cards, only now the winner is the card that has more factors. For example, 12 beats 16 because 12 has 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12) while 16 has 5 factors (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16). The holder of the winning card must be able to correctly list the factors to win the cards – otherwise, the cards get shuffled back into each player’s draw pile.

  "**The setup:** This game is lightly inspired by checkers. Each player has 10 counters. The counters are numbered from 1 to 10, with the “10” counter marked with 10 and 11. The counters start on the end rows of a 100-chart - one player on squares 1 to 10 and the other on squares 91 to 100.\n\n**How to play:** Initially, counters can only move “forward” one row onto any multiple of the number(s) on the marker they choose – for the player starting on 1 to 10, forward means larger numbers, and for the player starting on 91 to 100, forward means smaller numbers. Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can then move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it. A player’s piece cannot double up with another of the same player’s pieces.\n\n**How to win:** You win by taking all your opponent’s pieces.": "**准备工作:** 这个游戏从跳棋中汲取灵感。每个玩家有 10 个棋子。棋子编号为 1 到 10，其中“10”号棋子标有10和11。棋子最初放置在100以内数字表格的末行上。 一个玩家放在 1 到 10 的正方形上，另一个放在 91 到 100 的正方形上。\n\n**游戏规则:** 最初，棋子只能根据所选标记上的数字 (或数字) 的任何倍数向前移动一行——对于从1到10开始的玩家，向前意味着更大的数字，对于从91 到 100 开始的玩家，向前意味着更小的数字。一旦棋子穿过整个棋盘，它就变成“王”，然后可以向前或向后移动一行。 通过落在对手的棋子上可以吃掉对方的棋子。玩家的棋子不能与相同玩家的其他棋子重复放置。\n\n**获胜条件:** 吃掉所有对手的棋子即可获胜。",

  "Game": "游戏",
  "**The setup:** Each player starts with a 4 by 4 grid of numbers that are possible multiplication products – these numbers can either be randomly assigned or carefully chosen by the player.\n\n**How to play:** To start, two cards are dealt and put face up on the table. If either player has the product of those two numbers, they cover it. From then on, the players take turns taking the top card from the draw pile and choosing which of the two cards to replace. All players who have a match with the product cover it.\n\n**How to win:** The first player to get 4 in a row wins.": "**准备工作:** 每个玩家开始时拥有一个 4 x 4 的表格，表格中填入可能的乘积数字。这些数字可以随机分配，也可以由玩家仔细选择。\n\n**游戏规则:** 首先，发两张牌并朝上放置在桌面上。 如果任何玩家拥有这两个数字的乘积，他们就可以用标记盖住它。从那时起，玩家轮流从牌堆顶部取牌，并选择替换两张牌中的哪一张。 所有拥有匹配乘积的玩家都可以用标记盖住它。\n\n**获胜条件:** 最先得到 4 个相连的玩家获胜。",

  "1.1 Math Talk – Early and Often": "步骤1：数学对话——早期且频繁",
  "**Exposure:** During these early years, it is all about exposure! Your child is being exposed to a wide array of experiences and is discovering patterns in everything they experience. As part of exposing your child to the world, expose them to math words and ideas. Let them see how enjoyable it can be to play with math together.\n\n**Start early:** Start this even before your child seems to understand what you're saying. Your child is a sponge who is getting more from your words than you realize.\n\n**Point and describe:** Point at things your child interacts with and describe them with words involving numbers, shapes, and colors. If you are dealing with a small set of things, count them out loud to your child.\n\n**Many facets of Math Talk** There is much more math to talk about than just numbers.\n\n* Describe things. Talk about sizes, colors, textures, shapes, softness, wetness, hotness,\nbrightness, and more. Naming and describing properties is essential for comparing\nthem and discovering patterns.\n* Use comparison words. Bigger, smaller, tallest, widest, more, less, same, ...\n* Use position words. Over, under, between, near, far, above, ...\n* Talk about patterns and sequences in space and time. Refer to the order of things as\nfirst, second, third, and last. Talk about what just happened, what is about to happen,\nand things happening today. Talk about patterns in designs you see.\n* Count things out loud and say numbers to refer to quantities.\n* Use measurement words. Use words for length, area, weight, and volume whenever\nyou are describing sizes.\n\n**This is all math:** These different ways of describing things and their relationships is talking about math! Building up this vocabulary and concepts will help your child develop mathematically. It will also give a big boost to helping your child read and talk about the world.": "**接触:** 在这些早期年间，一切都与接触有关！您的孩子正在接触各种各样的体验，并在他们感知的一切中发现模式。作为让您的孩子接触世界的一部分，让他们接触数学词汇和思想。让他们看到一起玩数学是多么有趣。\n\n**早点开始: 即使在您的孩子似乎理解您的话之前就开始这样做。您的孩子就像海绵一样，从您的话中获取比您意识到的更多的东西。\n\n**指点和描述:** 指向您的孩子接触到的事物，并用涉及数字、形状和颜色的词汇来描述它们。如果您处理的是小数量的事物，请为您的孩子大声数出来。\n\n**数学对话的多个方面**\n\n* 描述事物。谈论大小、颜色、纹理、形状、柔软度、湿度、温度、亮度等等。命名和描述属性是比较它们和发现模式的基础。\n* 使用比较词汇。更大、更小、最高、最宽、更多、更少、相同等 ...\n* 使用位置词汇。上、下、之间、附近、远处、上方等 ...\n* 谈论空间和时间中的模式和顺序。用第一个、第二个、第三个和最后一个来指顺序。谈论刚发生的事情、即将发生的事情和今天发生的事情。谈论您看到的设计中的模式。\n* 大声数数并说出数字来表示数量。\n* 使用测量词汇。描述大小时使用长度、面积、重量和体积的词汇。\n\n**这都是数学:** 这些不同方式的描述和讨论都是数学。建造词汇和概念可以在数学方面帮助你的孩子。这也会很大程度上帮助你的孩子理解并且讨论世界上的一切。",
  "1.2 Math Talk – At Home": "步骤2：数学对话——在家里",
  "As you go about your household routines and activities together, there are many mathematical conversations to have with your child.\n\n**Putting things away:** Talk about which things belong together. Do things that are the same shape go together? Is there a special place for round things or triangular things?\n\n**Clothes:** If you are sorting clothes that are about to be washed or have just been washed, talk about colors, shapes, and sizes. When picking up clothes or putting them away, talk about why some clothes go in one place and others go in other places.\n\n**Going to sleep and getting up:** These times lend themselves to discussing doing things in order, and practicing words like first, second, third, last, and next.\n\n**Discuss as you read:** Storytime is a wonderful chance to do math with your child in a cozy setting. Talk about the characters and the things in the pictures. If there is a big yellow sun, point to the sun and say: “The sun is round and it is yellow. The wall of this room is also yellow. Point to something round in this room.”\n\nAs your child gets older, count together by pointing, such as the yellow flower petals in a picture, or ask your child to point to things you describe.\n\n**Food:** Whether putting food away, cooking food, or setting things out for mealtime, there are many opportunities for math. Different kinds of food should be put away in particular places – this is a good time for relationship words like inside, under, and over.\n\nCooking involves measuring quantities, talking about lengths of time, and describing the desired result for the food. Setting things out for mealtime involves setting out the appropriate number of things so that each person gets what they need.\n\n**Playing with objects:** Compare objects when constructing things for play or other uses. Which one is taller? Can you make one thing taller, wider, bigger, or the same as the other? Describe and compare the sizes, numbers, and colors of things you have or that are in pictures.": "当您和孩子一起进行日常家庭活动时，您会与孩子进行许多有关数学的对话。\n\n**收拾东西:** 讨论哪些东西应该放在一起。形状相同的东西可以放在一起吗？圆形或三角形的东西有特殊的位置吗？\n\n**衣服:** 如果你正在整理即将洗或刚洗过的衣服，可以谈谈颜色、形状和尺寸。在挑选或收拾衣服时，可以谈谈为什么有些衣服放在一个地方，而其他衣服放在其他地方。\n\n**准备去睡觉和起床:** 这些时间适合讨论按顺序做事，并练习诸如第一、第二、第三、最后和下一个之类的单词。\n\n**边读边讨论:** 讲故事时间是与孩子在舒适的环境中做数学题的绝佳机会。谈论图片中的人物和事物。如果有一个黄色的大太阳，指着太阳说：“太阳是圆的，是黄色的。这个房间的墙也是黄色的。指着这个房间里的圆形物体。”\n\n随着孩子年龄的增长，可以通过指向来一起数数，比如图片中的黄色花瓣，或者让孩子指向您描述的东西。\n\n**食物:** 无论是收拾食物、烹饪食物还是为用餐时间准备食物，都有很多机会使用数学。不同种类的食物应该放在特定的地方——这是使用关系词（如里面、下面和上面）的好时机。\n\n烹饪包括测量数量、讨论烹饪时间长度以及描述食物的预期效果。准备就餐时需要准备适当数量的食物，以便每个人都能得到自己需要的食物。\n\n**玩物品:** 在为游戏或其他用途构建物品时，比较物体。哪一个更高？你能把一个东西做得更高、更宽、更大或与另一个东西一样吗？描述并比较你拥有的或图片中的东西的大小、数量和颜色。",
  "1.3 Math Talk – Out and About": "步骤3：数学对话——外出时",
  "**Shapes:** You might see a circle in a design in a building and ask your child to point out other circles they see, such as the circles in a traffic light. Traffic signs and shop signs provide a great supply of shapes you can describe and name. There is no end to the shapes, colors, and counting that you can find and talk about once you make a habit of looking for them.\n\n**Traveling:** There are many mathematical things to talk about as you travel. If you see a somewhat unusual red car, you can point that out and count together other red cars that are like it. Ask about bigger, smaller, thinner, and wider things such as buildings, windows, trees, and people. Which things are closer than others, and which things are farther away?\n\n**Counting in a store:** Talk about how many apples you need, and count them out as you pick them out. Count the people in line in front of you, and compare that to the length of the other lines.\n\nPoint out the shapes of fruit or pictures on food boxes. Talk about how some things come in boxes, and other things come in round bottles. You might need something on a high shelf, or something on a low shelf. There is so much to describe and compare!\n\n**In a park:** Count the children, the number of structures or trees, or any- thing else. Comment about where there is more of one thing than an- other.\n\n**On the swings:** Pushing your child on something that swings or sways back and forth is a perfect opportunity to count with your child. With each push, count “1, 2, 3, 4, 5.” After your child starts learning how to count to 5, counting down from 5 is also a good idea. Start or end at 0 sometimes.\n\nPoint out the circles, curves, straight lines, triangles, and rectangles in the park. Talk about how some things are over, under, between, or on top of other things.": "**形状:** 您可能会看到建筑物设计中的一个圆圈，并要求您的孩子指出他们看到的其他圆圈，例如交通信号灯中的圆圈。交通标志和商店招牌提供了大量可供您描述和命名的形状。一旦养成寻找它们的习惯，您就可以找到并谈论无数的形状、颜色和计数。\n\n**旅行:** 旅行时，有很多数学话题可以讨论。 如果你看到一辆有点不寻常的红色汽车，你可以指出它，并计算出其他类似的红色汽车。 询问更大、更小、更薄和更宽的事物，例如建筑物、窗户、树木和人。哪些事物比其他事物更近，哪些事物更远？\n\n**在商店里计数:** 谈谈你需要多少个苹果，并在挑选时数出它们的数量。数一数你前面排队的人，并将其与其他队伍的长度进行比较。\n\n指出水果的形状或食物盒上的图案。谈谈为什么有些东西装在盒子里，而其他东西装在圆瓶里。 你可能需要把某样东西放在高架子上，或者把某样东西放在低架子上。有太多东西可以描述和比较！\n\n**在公园里:** 数一数孩子的数量、建​​筑物或树木的数量，或其他任何东西的数量。评论一下哪里某样东西比另一样东西多。\n\n**荡秋千:** 将孩子推到可以来回摆动的东西上是与孩子一起数数的绝佳机会。每推一下，就数“1、2、3、4、5”。孩子开始学会数到 5 后，从 5 开始倒数也是一个好主意。有时可以从 0 开始或结束。\n\n指出公园里的圆形、曲线、直线、三角形和矩形。谈谈有些东西是如何位于其他东西之上、之下、之间或之上的。",
  "1.4 Math Talk – Describe, Compare": "步骤4：数学讨论——描述、比较",
  "**There is important math beyond numbers:** Describing and comparing things is an important part of helping your child learn early mathematics. When children do mathematics, they use ideas about properties of objects to help them work with those objects, such as in grouping them or finding patterns with them. These skills will also help your child when it comes time to start learn- ing to read.\n\n**Point, describe, and compare:** Wherever you are, get in the habit of pointing at things that catch your or your child's attention, and then describing them. Take the opportunity to compare those things to other things to help the descriptions be more meaningful. Talk about how two things are the same or how they are different.\n\n**It is never too early:** From the earliest ages, your child is learning from everything they see, hear, taste, touch, and experience. Add to those experiences with your Math Talk. They are benefiting from your words before they show any reaction to them. Eventually, they will put together the experiences from your words and start showing you that they understand them.\n\n**Expose, but do not rush:** Don't confuse early exposure with teaching. A child will put together the patterns from their experiences as they are developmentally ready. For example, you can't teach your child to count to 5 by explaining it to them – you can only expose them to your counting over and over again until it starts making sense to them. Never be impatient or push them to understand it more quickly – they have a lot to learn and they will naturally want to make sense of it all.\n\n**Searching game:** Make a game of searching for objects around where you are. Use the game to practice concepts that your child is learning, such as color, size (large, medium, small), weight (heavy, light), quantity, and relationship (inside, on top of, below).\n\nOne of you says to the other that they see something that is round on top of something that is brown. The other person tries to discover what it is. If they have trouble finding it, more clues are given.": "**除了数字之外，还有重要的数学:** 描述和比较事物是帮助孩子学习早期数学的重要部分。当孩子们做数学时，他们会利用关于物体属性的想法来帮助他们处理这些物体，例如对它们进行分组或用它们寻找模式。这些技能也会在孩子开始学习阅读时有所帮助。\n\n**指出、描述和比较:** 无论身在何处，都要养成指向引起您或您孩子注意的事物，然后描述它们的习惯。利用机会将这些事物与其他事物进行比较，使描述更有意义。谈论两件事如何相同或不同。\n\n**永远不会太早:** 从很小的时候起，您的孩子就开始从他们所看到、听到、尝到、触摸到和体验到的一切中学习。通过数学谈话来丰富这些经验。在他们做出任何反应之前，他们就已经从您的话语中受益匪浅。最终，他们会从您的话语中总结经验，并开始向您表明他们理解这些经验。\n\n**揭露，但不要着急:** 不要将早期接触与教学混为一谈。孩子在发育成熟后会将他们的经历中的模式整合在一起。例如，您不能通过向孩子解释来教他们数到 5——您只能一遍又一遍地向他们展示您的计数方式，直到他们开始理解为止。永远不要不耐烦或强迫他们更快地理解——他们有很多东西要学，他们自然会想要理解这一切。\n\n**搜寻游戏:** 玩一个寻找周围物体的游戏。利用这个游戏来练习孩子正在学习的概念，例如颜色、大小（大、中、小）、重量（重、轻）、数量和关系（内部、顶部、下方)。\n\n你们其中一人告诉另一人，他们看到一个圆形的东西放在棕色的东西上面。另一人试着找出那是什么。如果他们找不到，就会给出更多线索。",
  "1.5 Math Talk – Counting": "步骤5：数学讨论——计数",
  "**Counting, Numbers, and Quantities:** Counting and numbers are what comes to mind when most people think of early math, and they are the easiest to relate to and understand. Counting is also easy to verbalize in front of your child. There are several things to work on at the same time, so it can be more complicated for your child than what you might think.\n\n* Counting forward and backward, including 0 sometimes \n* Learning the numbers\n* Learning quantities\n\n**Repeating the sequence:** At first, all your counting in front of your child will lead to your child starting to repeat the numbers in sequence. Don't be surprised if they leave out some of the numbers or they say the numbers in the wrong order. If they make these errors, don't make a big deal out of it; simply say the count correctly and move on. This is all part of the process and they will eventually learn the numbers in the correct order.\n\n**Count down sometimes:** Counting down will help your child understand the sequence. This helps keep it from being a meaningless sequence of sounds they make that makes adults happy. You can do this almost any time you would have counted up. For example, if you have three apples you want to remove, count down from three after you take away each apple.\n\n**Include 0 sometimes:** Start your counting at 0 sometimes to help 0 become an accepted number and quantity. You can also count down to 0. Counting down to 0 is great for events that are about to happen, say in ten seconds. You can count down to 0 and then say \"Blastoff\" or something similar.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive to an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things about counting and quantities. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when they count something they do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers they're saying. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally, they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Count everything:** There are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it out loud in front of your child, and be sure to count down sometimes and to include 0 sometimes.": "**计数、数字和数量:** 大多数人想到早期数学时首先想到的是计数和数字，它们是最容易联系和理解的。计数也很容易在孩子面前用语言表达。由于需要同时进行多项练习，因此对孩子来说，这可能比您想象的要复杂得多。\n\n* 正向和反向计数，有时包括 0\n* 学习数字\n* 学习数量\n\n**重复这一过程:** 一开始，你在孩子面前数数会让孩子开始按顺序重复数字。如果他们漏掉了一些数字，或者说出了错误的顺序，请不要感到惊讶。如果他们犯了这些错误，不要太在意；只要正确地说出数字，然后继续。这都是过程的一部分，他们最终会以正确的顺序学习数字。\n\n**有时倒数:** 倒数可以帮助孩子理解顺序。这有助于避免他们发出毫无意义的声音序列，而这些声音会让成年人感到高兴。几乎任何时候你都可以这样做。例如，如果你有三个苹果要拿走，那么在你拿走每个苹果后，从三开始倒数。\n\n**有时包括 0:** 有时从 0 开始计数，有助于让 0 成为公认的数字和数量。您也可以倒数到 0。倒数到 0 非常适合即将发生的事件，例如十秒后。您可以倒数到 0，然后说“Blastoff”或类似的话。\n\n**理解数量:** 对于成年人来说，如果你数一堆东西，比如说四块鹅卵石，当你数“1、2、3、4”时，你说出的最后一个数字就是你拥有的东西的数量大小，这是完全直观的。你的孩子正在学习一些关于计数和数量的知识。他们正在对数量产生理解。他们正在学习当他们数东西时，他们会将东西和他们所说的数字一一对应。他们正在学习计数的顺序并不重要。最后，他们正在学习“最后一个数字是大小”的规则。成年人认为这些事情是理所当然的，但对于孩子来说，学习这些事情是很重要的。要有耐心，记住不要着急。\n\n**计算一切:** 有太多东西需要数数。数椅子、走一小段距离需要走多少步、食物、排队的人、一群人、桌子周围或房间里的家具、手臂、腿，还有谁知道还有什么。每当你发现自己在心里数着某样东西时，就在孩子面前大声数数，一定要有时倒数，有时包括 0。",
  "1.6 Math Talk – Point, Describe, Ask": "步骤6：数学对话——指出、描述和提问",
  "**Responding:** Once your child is able to respond to what you say, that will allow you to start asking questions. Your \"Point and Describe\" Math Talk will now become Point, Describe, and Ask. Even before your child can say words, they will start to respond nonverbally to you as they begin to make sense of your words.\n\n**Ask questions:** Use this new level of communication to make it clearer which ideas your child understands. \"Where is the bird?\" or \"Where is the ball? makes it clear if your child knows what a bird or ball is. Similarly, \"Point to the tree.\" or \"Point to a car.\" works for those two concepts.\n\n**Handling mistakes:** Ask all kinds of questions. Ask which of two things is bigger or smaller. Ask where you are walking to. Ask where something belongs. All these questions are opportunities for your child to express their understanding and for you to clear up any misconceptions. If your child points to the wrong thing or picks up the wrong thing, simply point out the right thing and don't try to explain their mistake to them.\n\n**Do this while reading:** Now you can add asking questions to your pointing and describing as you read a story. Point to pictures in the story and ask the same questions you would ask about the things around you.\n\n**Simple riddles:** Play games with your child's new skill and have fun with it. Have fun unraveling puzzles together such as: \"There is something red under something blue. Where is it?\"": "**回应:** 一旦您的孩子能够回应您的话语，您就可以开始提问。您的“指出并描述”数学谈话现在将变成指出、描述和询问。甚至在您的孩子能够说话之前，他们就会开始用非语言方式回应您，因为他们开始理解您的话语。\n\n**问问题:** 使用这种新的沟通方式，让您的孩子更清楚地了解哪些概念。“鸟在哪里？”或“球在哪里？”可以清楚地表明您的孩子是否知道什么是鸟或什么是球。同样，“指向树。”或“指向汽车。”适用于这两个概念。\n\n**处理错误:** 问各种各样的问题。问两件东西中哪件更大或更小。问你要去哪里。问某物属于哪里。所有这些问题都是让您的孩子表达他们的理解并让您澄清任何误解的机会。如果您的孩子指向错误的东西或拿起错误的东西，只需指出正确的东西，不要试图向他们解释他们的错误。\n\n**阅读时这样做:** 现在，你可以在阅读故事时，在指点和描述中添加提问。指着故事中的图片，问一些与你对周围事物提出的问题相同的问题。\n\n**简单的谜语:** 和孩子一起玩新技能的游戏，享受其中的乐趣。一起解开谜题，享受其中的乐趣，例如：“蓝色物体下面有红色物体。它在哪里？”",
  "1.7 Object Properties": "步骤7：对象属性",
  "**Your child responds!:** All the pointing, describing, and asking you have been doing with your child has established that things have properties that can be discussed and reasoned with. You have been building up a vocabulary of words and concepts for describing things. It is time to start making more use of them.\n\n**Ask for things with a specific property:** Practice using properties by asking your child to bring you something with that property. You could ask \"Please bring me something that is red.\" for example. As your child gets better at this, make the requests more complicated by combining more than one property – \"Find a round wooden thing.\"\n\n**Grouping things with a property:** Practice grouping things with the same property. If your child has a collection of objects, ask to have all the round things put to one side.": "**你孩子的回答！:** 你对孩子所做的所有指点、描述和询问都已经确立了事物具有可以讨论和推理的属性。你一直在建立用于描述事物的词汇和概念。现在是时候开始更多地使用它们了。\n\n**寻找具有特定属性的物品：** 通过要求您的孩子给您带来具有该属性的物品来练习使用属性。例如，您可以问“请给我带来一些红色的东西。”随着您的孩子在这方面的进步，通过结合多个属性使请求变得更加复杂——“找到一个圆形的木制物体。”\n\n**根据属性对事物进行分组:** 练习将具有相同属性的物品分组。如果您的孩子有一组物品，请要求将所有圆形物品放在一边。",
  "**A circle for each property:** Make this more visible by drawing a big circle and having all the things that have a particular property put in that circle. For example, you could have all the things with a hole in them put in the circle. As this becomes easy for your child, use two circles that overlap – one circle could be for triangles, the other for things with holes, and the common area to the two circles would be for triangles with holes.": "**每个属性一个圆圈:** 画一个大圆圈，将所有具有特定属性的事物放入圆圈中，使这一点更加明显。例如，你可以将所有有洞的事物放入圆圈中。当您的孩子觉得这很容易做到时，使用两个重叠的圆圈——一个圆圈可以表示三角形，另一个圆圈表示有洞的事物，两个圆圈的公共区域可以表示有洞的三角形。",
  "**Which one doesn't belong?:** A fun activity for practicing with proper- ties is to show your child a small set of objects and ask which of them doesn't belong. Challenge your child to identify the object that is not like the others and to explain why. Accept any reason that makes sense; your child may have an unusual reason.\n\nFor example, you could have pictures of some animals. Perhaps only one of them can fly. Maybe only one of them has two legs. This ac- tivity can provide fun challenges that let your child do some creative thinking with new concepts.": "**哪一个不属于?:** 练习属性的一个有趣活动是向孩子展示一小组物体，并询问其中哪些不属于。挑战孩子找出与其他物体不同的物体并解释原因。接受任何合理的理由；您的孩子可能有一个不寻常的理由。\n\n例如，你可以放一些动物的图片。也许只有其中一种动物会飞。也许只有其中一种动物有两条腿。这项活动可以提供有趣的挑战，让您的孩子用新概念进行创造性思考。",
  "1.8 Same and Different": "步骤8：相同与不同",
  "**Comparing:** Help your child understand properties better by comparing and contrasting them.\n\n**Examples:** For example, talk about the size or age of a child and an adult – one is younger and the other older, and one is shorter and the other is taller. Or you could talk about a bird and a dog – one can fly and has feathers and the other has fur and cannot fly.\n\n**Same and different:** Make a playful activity out of this by showing your child two objects and asking how they are the same and how they are different. Be prepared for surprising ideas and do include silly suggestions along with the more serious ones.\n\n**More examples:** If you hand your child a spoon and fork, there are many things your child might say. They are the same because you eat with both of them. They are also the same because you hold both of them, they are about the same size, or they are made of the same material. They are different because one is smooth and somewhat round, while the other is pointed.": "**比较:** 通过比较和对比帮助您的孩子更好地理解属性。\n\n**例子:** 例如，谈论一个孩子和一个成年人的体型或年龄——一个比较小，另一个比较大，一个比较矮，另一个比较高。或者你可以谈论一只鸟和一只狗——一只可以飞，有羽毛，另一只有毛，不能飞。\n\n**相同与不同:** 让这项活动变得有趣，向孩子展示两件物品，并询问它们有何相同之处和不同之处。准备好接受令人惊讶的想法，并在提出更严肃的建议的同时加入一些愚蠢的建议。\n\n**更多示例:** 如果你递给孩子一把勺子和一把叉子，孩子可能会说很多话。它们是相同的，因为你用它们吃饭。它们也是一样的，因为你拿着它们，它们大小差不多，或者它们是由相同的材料制成的。它们是不同的，因为一个是光滑的，有点圆，而另一个是尖的。",
  "1.9 Patterns": "步骤9: 图案",
  "Patterns are everywhere! Recognizing, describing, and creating patterns is central to playing with mathematics.": "图案无处不在！识别、描述和创建图案是玩数学的关键。",
  "Here are some characteristics that can be used by themselves or mixed together to create patterns:\n\n* Movement patterns: stepping, jumping, waving, nodding\n* Sound patterns: clapping, knee slapping, tongue clicking, stamping \n* Loudness patterns: soft, medium, loud\n* Visual patterns: color, shape, size\n\n**Discover patterns:** Challenge each other to find repeating patterns wherever you are. You might notice a repeating tile work in a floor, wall, or ceiling. The brick work of a building might make an interesting pattern. Plants may be planted in an organized pattern in a field. The side of a pineap- ple or pine cone may have a spiral pattern. Something may be producing sounds in a repeating pattern.\n\n**Game: Repeat patterns:** Two or more of you can challenge each other to repeat and extend each other's patterns. This can be done in many ways. The simplest is for one person to create a pattern of sounds and movements and have all the others repeat it.\n\nAdd difficulty to this by having the original person add one more item to the end of the pattern every time the pattern goes once around the group. Alternatively, each person can take the pattern that comes to them and one more item at the end of it.\n\n**Secret handshakes or knocks:** Use patterns as an agreed upon way for being allowed to enter some place such as a room. This might be a series of fist bumps and other type of handshakes. Or it might be knocking and stamping that causes a series of sounds.\n\n**Sequence of drawings:** For older children, create puzzles by drawing a pattern of shapes. One person establishes a pattern and then leaves gaps in the repeating sequence for the other to fill in.": "以下是一些可以单独使用或混合使用以创建模式的特征:\n\n* 运动方式：迈步、跳跃、挥手、点头\n* 声音模式：拍手、拍膝盖、咂舌、跺脚\n* 响度模式：轻、中、响\n* 视觉图案：颜色、形状、大小\n\n**探索图案:** 挑战彼此，无论身在何处，都要找到重复的图案。您可能会注意到地板、墙壁或天花板上有重复的瓷砖图案。建筑物的砖砌结构可能会形成有趣的图案。植物可能以有组织的图案种植在田野中。菠萝或松果的侧面可能有螺旋图案。某些东西可能会以重复的模式发出声音。\n\n**游戏：重复图案:** 你们两个或两个以上的人可以互相挑战，重复和扩展彼此的模式。这可以通过多种方式实现。最简单的方法是让一个人创建一个声音和动作的模式，然后让所有其他人重复它。\n\n让最初的人每次图案在小组中转一圈时在图案的末尾添加一个物品，从而增加难度。或者，每个人都可以拿起来到他们身边的图案，并在图案的末尾添加一个物品。\n\n**秘密握手或敲门:** 使用模式作为获准进入某个地方（例如房间）的约定方式。这可能是一系列的拳头碰击和其他类型的握手。或者可能是敲门和跺脚，从而发出一系列声音。\n\n**绘图顺序:** 对于年龄较大的孩子，可以通过绘制形状图案来制作拼图。一个人建立一个图案，然后在重复的序列中留下空白，让另一个人填补。",
  "1.10 Basic Shapes I": "步骤10：基本形状 I",
  "**The world of shapes:** There are many possibilities that open up as your child's understanding of properties grows. For example, they can now understand geometric shapes and talk about them!\n\n**Counting sides:** Distinguishing between a triangle, square, rectangle, hexagon, and octagon will involve the idea of \"sides\" and being able to count those sides. Your child's growing understanding of quantities will make this counting possible. Also, as your child begins to automatically identify these shapes, that will help them to deepen their understand of the quantities for 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n**Basic shapes:** For now, stay with basic shapes and build confidence and fluency with those shapes. Of course, you can always mix in any additional shapes, such as stars, that your child happens to enjoy.\n\nHere is a list of words for flat shapes:\n\n* Circle\n* Triangle\n* Rectangle (looks like a piece of paper) \n* Square (rectangle with equal sides)\n* Hexagon (6 sides)\n* Octagon (8 sides – stop sign)\n\nThis is a list of words for 3-dimensional shapes:\n\n* Ball (Sphere)\n* Cylinder (Round tube) \n* Box (Cube)\n\n**Hands on:** Use and explain these shape names as your child plays with objects that have these shapes.

  "2.1 Counting Up From 1 and 0": "步骤11：从 1 和 0 开始计数",
  "**Count everything:** Your child can already count to 5. You are now helping them to solidify that counting and as well as extend it to larger numbers. Count things in front of your child and also count with your child when your child wants to. Counting is the foundation of understanding quantities. It also builds a basis for addition and subtraction.\n\nThere are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it with your child, and be sure to include 0 as a starting point sometimes.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive for an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4,\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things. They are gaining an understanding of quantities.

Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Mistakes:** There are many kinds of mistakes you should expect your child to make as they count. Your child may leave out numbers or they may leave out some of the numbers. Or they may get mixed up in doing 1-1 correspondence with a group of things they are counting. Your child will sort all this out with time. For now, when your child makes a mistake, simply count the things out in front of them correctly and move on to something else.\n\n**Understand the numbers:** Don't be in such a hurry for your child to repeat the numbers 1 to 10 that they have no idea what they are saying. Take time with it and reinforce the connection of each number with its corresponding quantity.\n\n**Reading numbers:** You may of course start introducing reading the numbers whenever you like. However, don't let the reading limit the counting. Learning to read numerals will typically take longer than learning to say the numbers and getting a sense of the quantities.": "**数一切:** 您的孩子已经可以数到 5 了。您现在正在帮助他们巩固数数能力，并将其扩展到更大的数字。在孩子面前数数，并在孩子愿意的时候和他一起数数。数数是理解数量的基础。它还为加法和减法奠定了基础。\n\n需要数的东西太多了。数椅子、走一小段距离需要走多少步、食物、排队的人、一群人、桌子周围或房间里的家具、手臂、腿，还有谁知道还有什么。每当你发现自己在心里数着某样东西时，就和你的孩子一起数，有时一定要把 0 作为起点。\n\n**理解数量:** 对于成年人来说，如果你数一堆东西，比如说四块鹅卵石，当你数“1、2、3、4”时，你说的最后一个数字就是你拥有的东西的数量。你的孩子正在学习几件事。他们正在对数量产生理解。他们正在学习当你数某样东西时，你会在东西和数字之间建立一一对应的关系。他们正在学习计数的顺序并不重要。最后，他们正在学习“最后一个数字是大小”的规则。成年人认为这些事情是理所当然的，但对于孩子来说，学习这些事情是很重要的。要有耐心，记住不要着急。\n\n**错误:** 您应该预料到孩子在数数时会犯许多错误。孩子可能会漏掉一些数字，或者漏掉一些数字。或者，他们可能会搞混他们正在数的一组东西的 1-1 对应关系。随着时间的推移，您的孩子会理清所有这些问题。现在，当您的孩子犯错时，只需正确地数出他们面前的东西，然后继续做其他事情。\n\n**理解数字:** 不要急着让孩子重复 1 到 10 的数字，否则他们根本不知道这些数字在说什么。花点时间，强化每个数字与其对应数量的联系。\n\n**读取数字:** 当然，您可以随时开始学习阅读数字。但是，不要让阅读限制计数。学习阅读数字通常比学习说数字和了解数量需要更长的时间。",
  "2.2 Counting Down to 1 and 0": "步骤12：倒数至 1 和 0",
  "**It helps with meaning:** Counting down is surprisingly effective at solidifying understanding of the number sequence. Many very young children who have learned to count from 1 to 10 have a difficult time when they first try to count from 10 down to 1. This counting in the opposite order forces them to think in a fresh way about how the numbers are ordered. This will be particularly true when your child starts counting to 100 and they start thinking about what happens as they go from one decade to the next – say between 69 and 70.\n\n**It helps with subtraction:** Counting down is also very helpful with learning to subtract. A child who can count down will very quickly learn how to subtract 1 and 2. It is also helpful if counting down becomes automatic, so they can use their full attention on counting down the three steps when doing 9 subtract 3, for example.\n\n**Use when natural:** There are many times when counting down is the natural thing to do. If there are ten seconds left on a timer, you can count down together with the counter. If you say that something can be done three more times, then you can count down from three together.\n\n**Include 0:** It is usually natural to include 0 when counting down, and this is a good thing to do. If you are counting down the time remaining, when you reach 0 you have 0 seconds left. If you count down how many pieces of food your child can eat, when you reach 0 there will be no food left. It is helpful to make 0 a normal and expected quantity to work with.": "**它有助于理解意义:** 倒数对于巩固对数字序列的理解非常有效。许多已经学会从 1 数到 10 的幼儿在第一次尝试从 10 数到 1 时会遇到困难。这种反向计数迫使他们以新的方式思考数字的排序方式。当你的孩子开始数到 100 时，他们会开始思考从一个十年到下一个十年会发生什么——比如从 69 到 70。\n\n**它有助于减法:** 倒数对于学习减法也很有帮助。会倒数的孩子很快就能学会减 1 和 2。如果倒数能成为一种习惯，那么他们就可以全神贯注地倒数三个步骤，例如，在做 9 减 3 时。\n\n**自然情况下使用:** 很多时候，倒计时是很自然的事情。如果计时器还剩 10 秒，你可以和计数器一起倒计时。如果你说某件事还可以做三次，那么你可以和计数器一起从三开始倒计时。\n\n**包括 0:** 倒计时时通常自然会包含 0，这是件好事。如果您倒计时剩余时间，当计数到 0 时，您就剩下 0 秒了。如果您倒计时孩子可以吃多少块食物，当计数到 0 时，就没有食物了。将 0 设为正常的预期数量会很有帮助。",
  "2.3 Comparing Small Quantities": "步骤13：比较小数量",
  "**It takes time:** All these beginning concepts and skills take lots of time for your child to master, and comparing quantities and getting a sense of the size of quantities is no different. Create many, many experiences that allow your child to touch, feel, and directly experience the sizes of quanti- ties and how they compare.\n\n**Line them up:** One simple way to compare the sizes of two quantities is to line them up in 1-to-1 correspondence next to each other. For example, if you play a card game and you want to see who won, you can line up the cards of the two players and see which line has extra cards.\n\n**Common misunderstanding:** Be aware that a small child may think that two short sticks is the same amount as one long stick. This is perfectly understandable, but it is often not what the adult had in mind.\n\n**Give choices:** Put your child in situations where they can choose between two groups of of the same things they really like. When they pick the bigger group, reinforce it by saying that the chosen group had more than the other group.\n\n**Games:** You may be able to start playing simple card games, such as the game of \"War.\" Use the dots on the cards to allow your child to compare the quantities. Another good game to practice with is \"I'm Thinking of a Number,\" where you have a number line of cards with something hidden under one of the cards.\n\n**Number lines:** Number lines are an excellent visual aid for seeing which numbers are smaller (the ones on the left) and which are larger (the ones on the right). This is a good thing to expose your child to from an early age, but be aware that both the numerals and their being in a line is fairly abstract, so it will be a while before they understand what is going on with this picture that has numbers.": "**这需要时间:** 所有这些初级概念和技能都需要孩子花费大量时间才能掌握，而比较数量和了解数量大小也同样如此。创造许多体验，让您的孩子触摸、感受和直接体验数量的大小及其比较方式。\n\n**把它们排成一行:** 比较两个量的大小的一个简单方法是将它们一一对应地排成一排。例如，如果你玩纸牌游戏，想知道谁赢了，你可以把两个玩家的牌排成一排，看看哪一行有多余的牌。\n\n**常见误解:** 请注意，小孩子可能会认为两根短棍和一根长棍一样多。这是完全可以理解的，但这通常不是成年人的想法。\n\n**给选择:** 让您的孩子在两组他们真正喜欢的相同物品之间做出选择。当他们选择较大的组时，告诉他们所选的组比另一组有更多物品，以此来强化他们的选择。\n\n**游戏:** 你可以开始玩一些简单的纸牌游戏，比如“战争”游戏。利用纸牌上的点数让孩子比较数量。另一个适合练习的游戏是“我在想一个数字”，在这个游戏中，你有一排数字牌，其中一张牌下藏着一些东西。\n\n**数轴:** 数轴是一种很好的视觉辅助工具，可以帮助你看出哪些数字较小（左边的数字），哪些数字较大（右边的数字）。从小就让孩子接触数轴是一件好事，但要注意，数字和它们在一条线上是相当抽象的，所以他们需要一段时间才能理解这张有数字的图片是怎么回事。",
  "2.4 Counting On": "步骤14：继续",
  "**Surprisingly powerful:** The technique called Counting On is a simple idea that is surprisingly helpful. As your child gets comfortable with seeing a group of objects as a quantity, start doing Counting On in front of them to help them get the idea of it.\n\n**Example:** Suppose your child has one row of 3 cards and another row of 4 cards. They can count all the cards one at a time \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\" and see that there are 7 cards. However, if your child recognizes that there are three cards in one row, they don't need to count those cards. They can start their counting at 3, pointing to the three cards on the first row, and then count the second row \"4, 5, 6, 7.\" Your child is Counting On starting at 3, and that's where the name comes from.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** Being able to Count On saves time and effort. It also signals that your child is getting comfortable seeing the quantity associated with a group of objects and can work with them as a group. This is a big conceptual leap that will be very useful to them in all the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing soon to come.\n\n**Connection with addition:** Beginning addition is strongly linked to counting. When given a card with three dots on it, and another card with four dots on it, a child asked to add these two quan- tities will count them from 1 to 7. It is faster and more powerful to do this adding of 3 and 4 by starting at 3, or 4, and counting on using the other number. You will see finger techniques for doing this in upcoming lessons.": "**出人意料的强大:** 计数技巧很简单，但非常有用。当您的孩子习惯将一组物体视为一个数量时，开始在他们面前进行计数，以帮助他们理解这个概念。\n\n**例子:** 假设您的孩子有一排 3 张卡片，另一排 4 张卡片。他们可以一次数出所有卡片“1、2、3、4、5、6、7”，并看到有 7 张卡片。但是，如果您的孩子认识到一行中有三张卡片，他们就不需要数那些卡片了。他们可以从 3 开始数数，指向第一排的三张卡片，然后数第二排“4、5、6、7”。您的孩子从 3 开始数数，这就是这个名字的由来。\n\n**理解数量:** 能够“数数”可以节省时间和精力。这也表明您的孩子已经习惯了观察与一组物体相关的数量，并可以将它们作为一个整体来处理。这是一个巨大的概念飞跃，对他们即将进行的所有加、减、乘、除运算非常有用。\n\n**与加法的联系:** 开始学习加法与数数密切相关。当给孩子一张上面有三个点的卡片和另一张上面有四个点的卡片时，要求他们把这两个数字相加的孩子会从 1 数到 7。从 3 或 4 开始，用另一个数字数数，这样可以更快、更有效地完成 3 和 4 的加法。您将在接下来的课程中看到如何用手指做这件事。",
  "2.5 Basic Shapes II": "步骤15：基本形状 II",
  "**Deepening explorations:** Bit by bit, your child's developing skills with shapes, counting, and de- scriptions will allow you to include more detailed and advanced aspects of shapes. Use lots of hands-on experiences for your child. Have your child fit pieces together, pile things on top of each other, put things inside other things, and study how shapes are put together in all the objects around them. As your child experiences these things, name and discuss the shapes, and ask lots of questions about them.\n\n**Shape words:** It may seem like there are a lot of words to learn. However, if you make a habit of exposing your child to these words, your child will pick them up slowly but surely.\n\nThis is a list of flat shapes:\n\n* Parallel lines (railroad tracks, two lines in the same direction that don't meet) \n* Right angle (angle found in the corner of a piece of paper)\n* Circle\n* Triangle\n* Rectangle (looks like a piece of paper, it has four right angles) \n* Square (rectangle with equal sides)\n* Parallelogram (opposite sides are parallel)\n* Rhombus (has four equal sides)\n* Trapezoid (one pair of parallel sides) \n* Pentagon (five sides)\n* Hexagon (6 sides)\n* Octagon (8 sides, stop sign)\n\nThis is a list of 3-dimensional shapes:\n\n* Sphere (Ball)\n* Cylinder (Round tube)\n* Box (Cube)\n* Pyramid (with a triangle or square as base)\n\n**Symmetries:** A lot of shapes have one side that looks like the other side upon being reflected. This is called mirror symmetry. The outside shape of a human body has mirror symmetry.\n\n**Tilings:** Point out tiling patterns to your child. A lot of buildings have tiling patterns on floors, walls, or ceilings. Brick walls often have interesting patterns made by their bricks. These patterns often have mirror symmetries.": "**深化探索:** 随着孩子对形状、计数和描述的技能逐渐发展，您将能够更详细、更高级地了解形状。让孩子多做亲身体验。让孩子将零件拼合在一起，将东西堆叠在一起，将东西放在其他东西里面，并研究周围所有物体的形状是如何组合在一起的。当您的孩子体验这些事情时，说出形状的名称并进行讨论，并提出大量有关它们的问题。\n\n**形词:** 看起来似乎有很多单词需要学习。但是，如果你养成让孩子接触这些单词的习惯，孩子就会慢慢但稳步地学会它们。\n\n这是平面形状的列表：\n\n* 平行线（铁轨，同方向但不相交的两条线）\n* 直角（纸张角落处的角）\n* 圆圈\n* 三角形\n* 矩形（看起来像一张纸，有四个直角）\n* 正方形（边相等的长方形）\n* 平行四边形（对边平行）\n* 菱形（四条边相等）\n* 梯形（一对边平行）\n* 五角大楼（五条边）\n* 六边形（6 条边）\n* 八边形（8 条边，有停车标志）\n\n这是三维形状的列表:\n\n* 球体(球)\n* 气缸（圆管）\n* 盒子（立方体）\n* 金字塔（以三角形或正方形为底面）\n\n**对称性:** 许多形状在反射时，一侧看起来与另一侧相似。这称为镜像对称。人体的外形具有镜像对称性。\n\n**平铺:** 向孩子指出瓷砖图案。许多建筑物的地板、墙壁或天花板上都有瓷砖图案。砖墙通常有砖块制成的有趣图案。这些图案通常具有镜像对称性。",
  "2.6 One More and One Less": "步骤16：多一个，少一个",
  "**More important than they look:** It is tempting to think of these ideas as minor, almost trivial steps. However, the ideas of One More and One Less are early and important steps for adding and subtracting.\n\n**Counting up and down:** One more and one less are strongly connected to the ideas of the next number and previous number when you are counting up and down. Counting practice with count- ing both directions will help make it easy for your child to know which number comes next and which number was the previous one.\n\n**Adding 1 and taking away 1:** Combine these ideas with adding and subtracting by asking ques- tions such as: \"How many pebbles do you have now? If I added 1 more, how many would you have? If I took 1 away so you had 1 less, how many would you have?\" These are very easy and natural questions to fit into everyday conversation, and your child can talk about them without ever considering that they are doing addition and subtraction.\n\nIf you have 3 of something and your child has four of that thing, you can discuss various possibilities. Would you have the same amount if you had one more? Would you have the same amount if your child has one less. Be playful with the idea. If your numbers are 3 and 5, you can talk about getting one more twice, or about one of you getting one more and the other getting one less.\n\n**Extend from 1 to 2:** When your child is ready, extend your child's understanding to what happens when you have two more or two less. There is no hurry to get to this, so please make sure your child first thoroughly understands one more and one less.\n\n**Games:** With this simple bit of arithmetic, you can start playing some games with adding and subtracting. A very simple one is to play the game of Nim with 1 and 2 using either addition or subtraction. Other games are Get Out of My House and Within 1 or 2": "**比看上去更重要:** 人们很容易认为这些想法是微不足道的、几乎微不足道的步骤。然而，“多一个”和“少一个”的想法是加法和减法的早期重要步骤。\n\n**上下计数:** 当你上下数数时，多一个和少一个与下一个数字和前一个数字的概念密切相关。双向计数练习将帮助您的孩子轻松知道下一个数字是什么，前一个数字是什么。\n\n**加 1 和减 1:** 将这些想法与加减法结合起来，提出以下问题：“你现在有多少颗鹅卵石？如果我再加一颗，你现在有多少颗？如果我拿走一颗，你就少一颗，你现在有多少颗？”这些都是非常容易和自然的问题，可以融入日常对话中，你的孩子可以谈论这些问题，而不必考虑他们正在做加减法。\n\n如果您有 3 件东西，而您的孩子有 4 件，您可以讨论各种可能性。如果您多一件，您还会得到相同的数量吗？如果您的孩子少一件，您还会得到相同的数量吗？发挥一下这个想法。如果您的数字是 3 和 5，您可以谈论两次多得到一件，或者你们其中一个人多得到一件，另一个人少得到一件。\n\n**从 1 扩展到 2:** 当您的孩子准备好时，请让您的孩子了解多两个或少两个会发生什么。不必着急讲这个，所以请确保您的孩子首先彻底理解多一个和少一个。\n\n**游戏:** 掌握了这些简单的算术知识后，你就可以开始玩一些加减游戏了。最简单的游戏是使用加法或减法玩 1 和 2 的尼姆游戏。其他游戏包括《离开我的房子》和《差1或2》。",
  "2.7 Finger Add and Subtract to 5": "步骤17：手指加减到 5",
  "**Adding by counting:** For a long time your child has been doing adding problems by counting. If they were asked to add two things to three things, that was done by counting all five things. As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things. This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Using fingers:** Children of this age will benefit greatly from having manipulatives to use when doing addition. It helps cement their understanding of the numbers in terms of quantities. Of course, the manipulative that is always available to them is their fingers. When doing our example of adding two to three, they can put up two fingers on one hand, three fingers on the other hand, and bring the two hands together. Another way to do it is to raise two fingers on one hand, raise three more fingers on that same hand, and then see a total of five fingers raised.\n\n**Add 0 sometimes:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually for your child.\n\n**Subtracting up to 5:** The ideas behind practicing subtraction are similar to those for addition. If your child is going to subtract three from five, have your chid raise five fingers and then lower three of them. Their familiarity with one less and two less will probably make subtracting one and two very easy.\n\n**Subtract 0 and everything sometimes:** Mix in questions where you subtract 0 sometimes. Also mix in questions where you subtract everything. For example, if you have three bits of food and you eat all of them, how many do you have left?\n\n**Memorizing:** As you ask your child to do various adding and subtracting problems that come along, your child will become more and more familiar with them and will eventually memorize them. While it is desirable to eventually make the recall of these facts automatic and easy for your child, there is no hurry.\n\n**Other math facts:** During this time your child's exposure to adding won't be restricted to those whose sum is 5 or less, and that is fine. For example, your child will probably have learned to add 1 or 2 to all the numbers up to 10. Your child may also have begun to learn the adding twin facts, such as 3 + 3 or 4 + 4.": "**通过计数进行添加:** 长期以来，您的孩子一直在通过计数来解决加法问题。如果要求他们将两件东西加到三件东西上，则通过计算所有五件东西来完成。随着您的孩子掌握了“继续计数”，部分计数被替换为从其中一个数字开始，例如本例中的 3，然后计算剩余的两个东西。这种计数经验还使您的孩子能够形象化和掌握“再加 1”和“再加 2”的概念，这使得 1 和 2 的加法变得容易得多。\n\n**使用手指:** 这个年龄段的孩子在做加法时如果能使用教具，将受益匪浅。它有助于巩固他们对数字的数量理解。当然，他们随时可以使用的教具就是手指。在做我们这个二加三的例子时，他们可以一只手伸出两根手指，另一只手伸出三根手指，然后将两只手合在一起。另一种方法是一只手伸出两根手指，另一只手伸出三根手指，然后看到总共伸出五根手指。\n\n**有时添加 0:** 有时还要加上 0。这很容易做到，而且对你的孩子来说，这在概念上很重要。\n\n**减去 5 以内:** 练习减法的思路与加法类似。如果你的孩子要从五中减去三，就让他举起五根手指，然后放下三根手指。他们对减一和减二的熟悉程度可能让减一和减二变得非常容易。\n\n**有时减去 0 和所有值:** 有时，会混入减去 0 的问题。还会混入减去所有东西的问题。例如，如果你有三块食物，你把它们全吃完了，你还剩下多少？\n\n**记忆:** 当你要求孩子做各种加减运算题时，孩子会越来越熟悉这些运算题，并最终记住它们。虽然希望孩子最终能够自动轻松地记住这些运算题，但不必着急。\n\n**其他数学事实:** 在此期间，您的孩子接触的加法不会仅限于总和为 5 或更少的数，这很好。例如，您的孩子可能已经学会了将 1 或 2 加到 10 以下的所有数字上。您的孩子可能还开始学习双胞胎加法，例如 3 + 3 或 4 + 4。",

If you use five or more fingers, put up five of those fingers on one hand so the two hands look like a ten frame. This activity also lays the groundwork for more easily using quantities on two hands for adding and subtracting.\n\n**Finger adding to 10:** If both numbers are five or less, put up the appropriate number of fingers on the two hands and count them up. Alternatively, put up the number of fingers for one of the numbers, and then count that many more fingers for the other number.

If you pair things up and then skip count them by 2's, you will reinforce how paired things come in twos.\n\n**Getting started with skip counting:** Introduce skip counting in two ways. One way is to take turns with your child as you count up to some number, alternating numbers as you go – one of you will be skip counting starting at 0, and the other will be starting at 1. After some practice, one of you stays silent and the other one counts as before, saying every other number.\n\nThe other way for your child to get used to skip counting is to count up to some number normally the first time. Then do that counting again by saying every other number softly. Continue this practice until the softly-spoken numbers are not spoken at all.\n\n**Start at numbers other than 0:** It is tempting to always start at 0. However, if you start at other numbers, such as 1, you will be helping your child with adding skills as well as multiplying and dividing skills.\n\n**Skip count downwards sometimes:** Skip counting downwards helps with subtracting skills and with dividing skills.": "**既快又有趣:** 向您的孩子展示这是一种有趣的计数方式，比按 1 计数要快得多。如果您将事物配对，然后跳过按 2 计数，您将强化配对事物如何以两个为单位。\n\n**开始跳过计数:** 以两种方式介绍跳数。一种方法是轮流和孩子一起数到某个数字，在数的过程中交替数数——你们中的一个从 0 开始跳数，另一个从 1 开始跳数。经过一些练习后，你们中的一个保持沉默，另一个像以前一样数数，说出其他数字。\n\n让孩子习惯跳过计数的另一种方法是，第一次正常地数到某个数字。然后轻声说出每个其他数字，再次进行计数。继续这种练习，直到轻声说出的数字完全不被说出。\n\n**从 0 以外的数字开始:** 总是从 0 开始是很诱人的。但是，如果从其他数字开始，例如 1，您将帮助您的孩子掌握加法技能以及乘法和除法技能。\n\n**有时跳过向下计数:** 跳过向下计数有助于减法技能和除法技能。",

Or, you can see the 3 blank squares and count this as 3 less than 10.\n\n**Be playful:** Play with all the different ways you and your child can do the counting. Seeing different ways to get the answer will open your child's eyes that math is about exploring and play, and not about arriving at an answer in some preferred way. All these different ways of counting will also develop a deeper understanding of quantities for your child.\n\n**Additive approaches:** One way to count up a group of objects is to add up the different parts of the group. That's what we did in this ten frame example when we added up 5 from the top row to the 2 in the bottom row.\n\n**Skip counting:** You may see a repeated pattern when you add up the parts of a group.

  "3.1 Mental Adding by Counting On": "步骤21：通过计数进行心算",
  "**Gradual change:** As your child develops skill with small adding and subtracting problems, gradually shift over to doing more of these calculations mentally. Don't be in a hurry to memorize. This time spent calculating answers by seeing the relationships between numbers will pay off handsomely in terms of a much better feel and understanding of numbers. If your child masters these facts by grinding through repeated drills with flash cards, you will have thrown away this important opportunity.\n\n**Counting on:** Use 6 + 3 as an example of adding by Counting On.\n\nInitially, your child will want to do this using their fingers, and that is fine. Say \"6\" and have a closed fist to indicate 0. Next, count up \"7, 8, 9\" and raise one finger with each number. Stop at 9, when three fingers have been raised.\n\nOver time, using fingers with small addition problems will become less necessary. Your child will start to mentally see the change of 3 in going from 6 to 9, and will no longer need to use fingers – just as they no longer need fingers for adding 1 or 2.\n\n**Start from the larger number:** With experience, your child will start to realize that it is easier and faster to start with the larger of the two numbers. For example, it is easier to do 3 + 6 as 6 Counted On with 3 more than it is do it as 3 Counted On with 6 more. Part of making this choice is realizing that the results of 3 + 6 and 6 + 3 are the same. This important observation will mean learning only about half as many addition facts!": "**渐变:** 随着您的孩子掌握了小加减运算的技能，逐渐转向在心算中做更多这样的计算。不要急于记住。花时间通过观察数字之间的关系来计算答案，将带来丰厚的回报，让您对数字有更好的感觉和理解。如果您的孩子通过反复练习抽认卡来掌握这些事实，那么您就浪费了这个重要的机会。\n\n**指望:** 使用 6 + 3 作为通过递增计数进行加法的示例。\n\n最初，您的孩子会想用手指来做这件事，这没问题。说“6”，并握紧拳头表示 0。接下来，数“7、8、9”，并在每个数字上举起一根手指。当举起三根手指时，停在 9 处。\n\n随着时间的推移，使用手指解决小加法问题将变得不那么必要。您的孩子将开始在脑海中看到从 6 到 9 的 3 的变化，并且不再需要使用手指 - 就像他们不再需要手指来加 1 或 2 一样。\n\n**从较大的数字开始:** 随着经验的积累，您的孩子将开始意识到从两个数字中较大的一个开始更容易、更快。例如，将 3 + 6 算成 6 加上 3 比将 3 加上 6 更容易。做出这一选择的一部分是意识到 3 + 6 和 6 + 3 的结果相同。这一重要观察意味着学习的加法知识只相当于原来的一半！",
  "3.2 Mental Subtracting – Take Away": "步骤22：心算减法——拿走",
  "**Two kinds of subtraction:** There are two models for subtraction, and both are important. The first is taking away. If you are asked to subtract 3 things from 9 things, you will probably think of this as taking away or removing 3 of the things. The second model involves difference. The difference between two numbers is the distance between them . If you are asked to subtract 7 from 9, you are likely to do this be finding how far apart they are, what their difference is.\n\nBoth understandings of subtraction are needed and are useful. For mental arithmetic, having a choice of using take away or difference can make a big difference in the ease of the calculation. Additionally, some problems are more naturally understood as take away or difference problems.\n\n**Counting down:** Counting down is a natural way to do take away. Use 9 - 3 as an example of subtracting by counting down.\n\nAs with adding, your child may want to initially do this using their fingers, and that is fine. Say \"9\" and have a closed fist to indicate 0. Next, count down \"8, 7, 6\" and raise one finger with each number. Stop at 6, when three fingers have been raised.\n\nOver time, using fingers with small subtraction problems will become less necessary. Your child will start to mentally see the change of 3 in going from 9 to 6, and will no longer need to use fingers – just as they no longer need fingers for subtracting 1 or 2.\n\n**Subtracting 1 to 4:** With practice, your child will build up speed using this approach for subtracting the numbers from 1 to 4. Take your time and make sure everyone enjoys the process.": "**两种减法:** 减法有两种模型，两种都很重要。第一种是减法。如果要求你从 9 个东西中减去 3 个东西，你可能会认为这是减去或移除了 3 个东西。第二种模型涉及差值。两个数字之间的差值就是它们之间的距离。如果要求你从 9 中减去 7，你很可能会通过找出它们之间的距离以及它们的差值来做到这一点。\n\n两种对减法的理解都是必要的，也是有用的。对于心算来说，选择使用减法或差法会对计算的难易程度产生很大的影响。此外，有些问题更自然地被理解为减法或差法问题。\n\n**倒数:** 倒数是进行减法的自然方法。以 9 - 3 为例，通过倒数进行减法。\n\n与加法一样，您的孩子最初可能想用手指来做，这没问题。说“9”，握紧拳头表示 0。接下来，倒数“8、7、6”，每数一个数字就举起一根手指。举起三根手指后，停在 6 处。\n\n随着时间的推移，用手指做小减法题的必要性将逐渐降低。您的孩子将开始在脑海中看到从 9 到 6 的 3 的变化，并且不再需要使用手指——就像他们不再需要手指来减去 1 或 2 一样。\n\n**减去 1 到 4:** 通过练习，您的孩子将使用此方法加快从 1 到 4 的减法速度。慢慢来，确保每个人都享受这个过程。",
  "3.3 Mental Subtracting – Difference": "步骤23：心算减法 – 差值",
  "**Distance or gap size:** If you are asked to find the difference between two numbers, you are doing a subtraction problem. Finding the difference is understood as finding the distance between the numbers, and this can be calculated by asking what number needs to be added to span the gap between them.\n\n**Counting On:** Use finding the difference of 9 and 6 as an example. Calculate this by keeping track of how many numbers you use as you Count On from 6 to 9. As with the instructions for adding in a previous learning step, this can be done with or without fingers. If your child has been practicing adding problems, they can probably very quickly count \"7, 8, 9\" and see that the gap is 3.\n\n**Subtracting and adding:** Using Counting On to find the difference is a great way to see the connec- tion between adding and subtracting. When we Counted On starting at 6 to add 6 + 3, we wanted to find the result of Counting On three times. When we Counted On from 6 to find 9 - 6, we knew the result of 9 and wanted to find out what we needed to add to 6 to get there.\n\n**Differences of 1 to 4:** With practice, your child will build up speed using this approach for finding differences of sizes 1 to 4. Take your time and make sure everyone enjoys the process.": "**距离或间隙大小:** 如果你被要求找出两个数字之间的差值，那么你正在做一道减法题。找出差值可以理解为找出数字之间的距离，这可以通过询问需要添加什么数字来跨越它们之间的差距来计算。\n\n**正数:** 以求 9 和 6 之间的差为例。通过记录从 6 数到 9 时使用的数字数量来计算。与上一学习步骤中的加法说明一样，这可以用手指或不用手指来完成。如果您的孩子一直在练习加法问题，他们可能可以非常快速地数出“7、8、9”，并发现差值为 3。\n\n**减法和加法:** 使用“数数”来求差是了解加法和减法之间联系的好方法。当我们从 6 开始数数，将 6 + 3 相加时，我们想求出数数三次的结果。当我们从 6 开始数数，求出 9 - 6 时，我们知道结果 9，并想找出需要将 6 加上多少才能得到这个结果。\n\n**1 至 4 之间的差:** 通过练习，您的孩子将提高使用此方法寻找 1 到 4 大小差的速度。慢慢来，确保每个人都享受这个过程.",
  "3.4 Number Bonds": "步骤24: 数的分解组合",
  "**Part and whole:** Seeing a whole thing as being made up of its parts is an important developmental step for a child. The number bonds for a number, say 6, are all the ways of pairing two numbers that add up to 6. It is all the ways of taking the whole of 6 and breaking it into two parts. This reinforces an understanding of the connection between addition and subtraction as forming groups of fact families – a topic to be covered in an upcoming learning step.\n\n**What's missing?:** Let's continue using number bonds for 6 as our example. The number bonds for 6 are: 0 + 6, 1 + 5, 2 + 4, and 3 + 3. A child who has learned these well will then have little trouble answering the question: \"What do I need to add to 2 to get 6?\" They will know that 2 + 4 is a number bond for 6, so 4 is the part of 6 that is missing.": "**部分与整体:** 把一个整体看作是由其各个部分组成的，这是孩子发展过程中的一个重要步骤。数字组合，例如 6，是将两个数字相加为 6 的所有方法。它是将 6 的整数部分分成两部分的所有方法。这加强了对加法和减法之间联系的理解，即形成事实系列组——这是即将学习的步骤中要介绍的主题。\n\n**少了什么东西？:** 让我们继续以 6 的数字键为例。6 的数字键为：0 + 6、1 + 5、2 + 4 和 3 + 3。学好这些的孩子将很容易回答这个问题：“我需要在 2 上加多少才能得到 6？”他们会知道 2 + 4 是 6 的数字键，因此 4 是 6 中缺失的部分。",
  "**Ten frames:** Fluency with number bonds for all numbers up to about 12 is very useful for doing adding and subtracting, The number bonds that arise the most often are those for 10. Ten frames are designed to help visualize number bonds for 10. A ten frame with 7 dots in it makes it visually obvious that 7 + 3 is a number bond for 10.\n\n**Games and puzzles:** There are quite a few games and puzzles that involve number bonds. Sum Groups is a puzzle designed to practice number bonds. Many games, such as Memory Challenge and Go Fish, have versions that use target totals and thereby exercise number bonds.": "**十框:** 掌握所有数字（大约到12）的数的分解组合对于进行加法和减法非常有用。最常出现的数的分解组合是10的分解组合。十框被设计用来帮助将10的分解组合可视化。在一个十框中放入7个点，可以直观地看到7 + 3是10的一个分解组合。\n\n**游戏和谜题:** 有相当多的游戏和谜题涉及数的分解组合。总和组是一个旨在练习数的分解组合的谜题。许多游戏，如记忆挑战和钓鱼，都有使用目标总数的版本，从而练习数的分解组合。",
  "3.5 Place Value": "步骤25：位置值",
  "**Meaning for the numbers 10 to 20:** At first, the numbers above 9 can be thought of as just the next numbers that come along. There is nothing wrong with that, and that viewpoint will work just fine for a long time. Eventually, with numbers all the way up to 100 coming on the horizon, it will be time to Introduce your child to the role of 10 in the numbers from 10 to 20.\n\n**Adding and subtracting 10:** Start this introduction by helping your child learn how to add 10 to single-digit numbers and subtract 10 from double-digit numbers from 10 to 20.\n\n**Practice with physical quantities:** Find something you have a lot of – perhaps pebbles, sticks, or toothpicks. Let's use 3 and 13 as an example. If you place 13 things on a flat surface, you can separate them into one group of 10 and one group of 3. This demonstrates both that 3 + 10 is 13, and also that 13 - 10 is 3.\n\n**Numerals:** If your child is ready to use numerals, write down 13 = 10 + 3 and 13 - 10 = 3 as you do the demonstration just described. When we write a two-digit number, such as 13, the place on the left is the tens place and the place on the right is the ones place. Then tens place tells how many tens the number has, and the ones place how many ones it has. For 13, it is made up of 1 ten and 3 ones, so 13 = 10 + 3. As another example, 20 is made up of 2 tens and 0 ones.\n\n**It takes time:** Breaking up a number into tens and ones, particularly symbolically with written numbers, is a big conceptual step and you should expect this to take many demonstrations, many explanations, and lots of time. As with so many of these foundational elements, your child will absorb it eventually and there is no hurry.": "**数字 10 至 20 的含义:** 一开始，9 以上的数字可以被认为是接下来出现的数字。这没有什么错，而且这种观点在很长一段时间内都适用。最终，随着 100 以内的数字的出现，是时候向你的孩子介绍 10 在 10 到 20 的数字中的作用了。\n\n**加减 10:** 首先帮助您的孩子学习如何将 10 加到个位数上，以及如何从 10 到 20 之间的两位数中减去 10。\n\n**物理量的练习:** 找一些你有很多的东西——可能是鹅卵石、木棍或牙签。我们以 3 和 13 为例。如果你将 13 件东西放在一个平面上，你可以将它们分成一组 10 件和一组 3 件。这既表明 3 + 10 等于 13，也表明 13 - 10 等于 3。\n\n**数字:** 如果您的孩子已经准备好使用数字，请按照刚才的演示，写下 13 = 10 + 3 和 13 - 10 = 3。当我们写一个两位数（例如 13）时，左边的位置是十位，右边的位置是个位。十位表示该数字有多少个十位，个位表示该数字有多少个个位。对于 13，它由 1 个十位和 3 个个位组成，因此 13 = 10 + 3。再举一个例子，20 由 2 个十位和 0 个个位组成。\n\n**这需要时间:** 将数字分解为十位数和个位数，尤其是用书面数字进行符号化，是概念上的一大进步，您应该预料到这需要很多演示、很多解释和很多时间。与许多这些基础元素一样，您的孩子最终会吸收它，不必着急。",
  "3.6 Fact Families": "步骤26：事实家族",
  "**A family of facts:** Addition and subtraction facts are easily grouped into facts that are closely related. Take this family of facts for example: 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 - 3 = 2, and 5 - 2 = 3. The picture below shows how these are interconnected.\n\nUse this kind of picture with your child. It shows one group of 3 dots, another group of 2 dots, and all together there are 5 dots. You can add the groups of dots in either order – either as 3 + 2 or 2 + 3 – and get the same result. If you take the 5 dots and you cover over one group, say the group of 2, then it is clear why 5 - 2 = 3.": "**一系列事实:** 加法和减法事实很容易归类为密切相关的事实。以这组事实为例：2 +3 = 5、3 + 2 = 5、5 - 3 = 2 和 5 - 2 = 3。下图显示了这些事实是如何相互关联的。\n\n让您的孩子使用这种图片。它显示一组 3 个点，另一组 2 个点，总共有 5 个点。您可以按任意顺序添加点组 - ​​3 + 2 或 2 + 3 - 并得到相同的结果。如果您取 5 个点并覆盖一组，比如 2 个点，那么 5 - 2 = 3 的原因就很明显了。",
  "**Adding and subtracting are related:** Fact families and their associated pictures make it very clear how closely tied together addition and subtraction are. One important part of their relationship is that they undo each other. If you start with 3 and add 2, and then subtract 2, you are back with having the original 3. Similarly, if you start with 5 and subtract 2, and then add 2, you are back to having the original 5.\n\n**Addition order doesn't matter:** Another important thing to reinforce about fact families is that they show that the order that addition is done in does not change the result. So, if your child is asked to do 4 + 8 and they prefer to do 8 + 4, then they can do that.": "**加法和减法是相关的:** 事实家族及其相关图片清楚地表明了加法和减法之间的紧密联系。它们之间关系的一个重要部分是它们相互抵消。如果你从 3 开始，然后加 2，然后减 2，你就会回到原来的 3。同样，如果你从 5 开始，然后减 2，然后加 2，你就会回到原来的 5。\n\n**添加顺序无关紧要:** 关于事实系列，另一个需要强调的重要事项是，它们表明加法的顺序不会改变结果。因此，如果您的孩子被要求做 4 + 8，而他们更喜欢做 8 + 4，那么他们可以这样做。",
  "3.7 Adding Twins and Near Twins": "步骤27：添加双胞胎和近双胞胎",
  "**Children like them:** Adding twins are when a number is added to itself, such as 3 + 3. Children generally enjoy adding twins, so they learn them eagerly and readily. The sums are also the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's, so that helps to reinforce these adding facts.\n\n**A foundation for doubling:** Knowing adding twins quickly leads to knowing how to double. Suppose you ask your child to double 3. They know that doubling something means to take two if it. So, doubling 3 means 3 plus 3, which is 6.\n\n**Near twins:** A pair of numbers is a near twin if they are one apart, such as 3 + 4. Once your child knows their adding twins, near twins is an easy next step. Think of 3 + 4 as 3 + 3 + 1, so it is 1 more than 3 + 3. So, 3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7. Alternatively, think of 3 + 4 as (4 - 1) + 3, which is 1 less than 4 + 4. So, 3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7. Allow your child to pick whichever approach they prefer for each near twin, or have fun doing them both ways.\n\nThis technique of using a familiar math fact to figure out a closely related math fact is powerful. It will help with learning many math facts in the months to come. Take your time and make sure your child thoroughly understands how this works. To explain it, demonstrate how 3 objects and 4 objects can be split up as 3 objects plus 3 objects plus one more – being able to see and touch things at this age is very powerful.": "**孩子们对此很感兴趣：** 双胞胎加法是指将一个数字加到自身上，例如 3 + 3。孩子们通常喜欢双胞胎加法，所以他们学起来很热切、很快。加法结果也是以 2 为单位跳过计数时得到的数字，因此这有助于强化这些加法事实。\n\n**倍增的基础:** 知道加倍后，很快就知道了如何加倍。假设你让孩子把 3 加倍。他们知道把某数加倍意味着减去 2。所以，把 3 加倍意味着 3 加 3，也就是 6。\n\n**近双胞胎:** 如果一对数字相差一个，那么它们就是近似双胞胎，例如 3 + 4。一旦您的孩子知道了他们的双胞胎加法，近似双胞胎就是下一步。将 3 + 4 视为 3 + 3 + 1，因此它比 3 + 3 多 1。因此，3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7。或者，将 3 + 4 视为 (4 - 1) + 3，比 4 + 4 少 1。因此，3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7。让您的孩子为每个近似双胞胎选择他们喜欢的方法，或者享受同时使用这两种方法的乐趣。\n\n这种使用熟悉的数学事实来推导密切相关的数学事实的方法非常有效。它将有助于在未来几个月内学习许多数学事实。花点时间确保您的孩子彻底理解其工作原理。为了解释这一点，演示如何将 3 个物体和 4 个物体拆分为 3 个物体加 3 个物体加 1 个物体——在这个年龄段能够看到和触摸东西是非常强大的。",
  "3.8 Multiply and Divide by 2": "步骤28：乘以 2 并除以 2",
  "**Connected concepts:** In the previous learning step we discussed doubling. This is connected to a surprising number of related concepts, as you will soon see.\n\n**Multiplying by 2:** Multiplying by 2 is the same as doubling. However, it uses interesting new wording that your child will need to get used to. When you first introduce the phrase of multiplying by 2, be sure to mix in the use of doubling from time to time to help with the transition. Your child will be getting used to the new words \"multiplying\" and \"times.\"\n\n**Half of something:** When something is doubled, such as 3 doubled is 6, then you can take half of the result and get back the original number. For example, suppose you picture 3 doubled as two rows of 3 things. Then taking half of those two matched rows is to take one of the rows, which is 3 things.\n\n**Equal sharing:** When you talk about taking half of something, you can combine that with the idea of sharing it equally among two people. If two people are to get equal shares, they will each get the same thing and that will be half of the original amount.\n\n**Dividing by 2:** If your child is comfortable with all the concepts so far in this learning step, then they are ready to talk about dividing! You can start talking about dividing something equally, or dividing it in two, or dividing by two. Mix together using all these phrases with your child – it will take time for them to absorb this new vocabulary. As far as the math is concerned, they have mastered all the ideas already!\n\n**Concrete examples:** Do lots of practice with each of these new ideas and words with groups of objects. Make your child's understanding be concrete rather than simply abstract. Anytime there is something to share among two people is a perfect time to practice. You can of course start extending this to sharing among more than two people if you like.\n\n**The beginning of multiplying and dividing:** As you have seen, this is the starting point of multi- plying and dividing. There are one or two new ideas, and a lot of new vocabulary. It's exciting to see your child step into this new part of the world!": "**相关概念:** 在上一个学习步骤中，我们讨论了加倍。这与大量相关概念有关，您很快就会看到。\n\n**乘以 2:** 乘以 2 与加倍相同。但是，它使用了有趣的新措辞，您的孩子需要习惯。当您第一次介绍乘以 2 的短语时，请务必不时地混合使用加倍的用法以帮助过渡。您的孩子将习惯新词“乘以”和“倍数”。\n\n**一半的东西:** 当某物翻倍时，例如 3 翻倍为 6，那么你可以取结果的一半并返回原始数字。例如，假设你将 3 翻倍为两行，每行 3 个东西。然后取这两行匹配的一半就是取其中一行，也就是 3 个东西。\n\n**平等分享:** 当你说拿一半时，你可以把它和两个人平等分享的想法结合起来。如果两个人要得到平等的份额，他们每人都会得到同样的东西，也就是原来数量的一半。\n\n**除以2:** 如果您的孩子已经熟悉了本学习步骤中的所有概念，那么他们就可以开始谈论除法了！您可以开始谈论将某物均等地分成两份或将其分成两份。将所有这些短语与您的孩子混合使用——他们需要时间来吸收这些新词汇。就数学而言，他们已经掌握了所有的概念！\n\n**具体例子:** 用一组物体对每个新想法和新词语进行大量练习。让孩子的理解具体化，而不是抽象化。任何时候两个人之间有东西可以分享，都是练习的最佳时机。当然，如果你愿意，你可以开始将分享扩展到两个人以上。\n\n**乘法和除法的开始:** 正如您所看到的，这是乘法和除法的起点。有一两个新想法，还有许多新词汇。看到您的孩子踏入这个世界的新领域真是令人兴奋！",
  "3.9 Skip Counting by 2's II": "步骤29：以 2 为单位跳过计数 II",
  "**New connections:** Your child started skip counting by 2's during Stage 2. Their skip counting is now going higher and faster, and it is also now connected with new ideas, such as with multiplying and with even and odd numbers.\n\n**Multiplying by 2:** For example, multiplying something by 2 means to take that many 2's. Suppose your child is calculating 5 times 2. This means adding 2 to itself 5 times, which is exactly what your child will get if they skip count by 2's 5 times starting at 0. Of course, they can also calculate this quantity by doubling the number, in this case 5.\n\n**Start anywhere and go up or down:** It is important to keep practicing skip counting by 2's starting anywhere and going up and down. This practice will be surprisingly helpful for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Get used to doing this practice anytime you have a somewhat large collection of things to count.\n\n**Even and odd numbers:** An even number is one that can be split in half evenly. It is a quantity that two people can share and have nothing left over. The odd numbers are the other numbers, the numbers that cannot be shared evenly. Even numbers are the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's starting at 0. Odd numbers are the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's starting at 1.\n\n**Skip count by other numbers:** If you like, this is a good time to start skip counting by other numbers. Skip counting by 10's, 11's, and 5's are good starting places.": "**新连接:** 您的孩子在第 2 阶段开始以 2 为单位跳数。现在他们的跳数越来越高、越来越快，并且还与新概念联系在一起，例如乘法、偶数和奇数。\n\n**乘以 2:** 例如，将某个数乘以 2 意味着取那么多的 2。假设您的孩子正在计算 5 乘以 2。这意味着将 2 加到自身上 5 次，这正是您的孩子从 0 开始跳过 2 的 5 次计数时得到的结果。当然，他们也可以通过将数字加倍来计算这个数量，在本例中为 5。\n\n**从任意位置开始向上或向下:** 重要的是要不断练习以 2 为单位跳数，从任意位置开始，然后不断增加和减少。这种练习对于加、减、乘、除非常有用。每当您要数的东西比较多时，就习惯做这种练习。\n\n**偶数和奇数:** 偶数是可以平均分成两半的数。它是两个人可以共享而不会剩下的东西。奇数是其他数，即不能平均分配的数。偶数是从 0 开始以 2 为单位跳过计数得到的数。奇数是从 1 开始以 2 为单位跳过计数得到的数。\n\n**按其他数字跳过计数:** 如果你愿意，现在正是开始用其他数字跳数的好时机。用 10、11 和 5 跳数都是不错的起点。",
  "3.10 Strategy Games": "步骤30：策略游戏 I",
  "**Developmental stage:** Strategy games are games where the players have choices that produce better or worse outcomes. These games have a lot to offer children. In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving. However, the difficulty with these is that they require rule following and a willingness to participate in organized play. If your child is not ready yet for this kind of play environment, please be patient and let them get to a developmental point where they are ready. There is plenty of time.\n\n**Be patient:** When children are first ready to play organized games and are introduced to a new game, you will probably need to be very patient. It could well be that the first ten times you attempt to play the game your child will have fun with all the pieces and do many things that have nothing to do with the game. This is a process. Your child needs to become familiar with the game and its pieces, and the novelty needs to wear off a bit. You will know when your child is ready and your patience has paid off.\n\n**Play around:** At first, it is likely that your child won't really have a sense of winning and losing, and won't understand that their choices make a difference. That's okay. You are just there to have fun together. Over time, as the game and its choices become more familiar, your child will start to see that their choices make a difference and that they care about those differences.\n\n**Invisible math sometimes:** Strategy games don't always involve numeric components, but they are mathematical anyway. Any strategy game offers many important learning opportunities, some mathematical and some not. As mentioned earlier, problem solving is high on the list of skills that are developed by these games. Critical thinking and logical communication are also being developed. The rule following and turn taking are very good for social-emotional learning.": "**发展阶段:** 策略游戏是玩家可以选择产生更好或更坏结果的游戏。这些游戏为孩子们提供了很多东西。特别是，它们自然会激励孩子们解决问题。然而，这些游戏的难点在于它们需要遵守规则并愿意参与有组织的游戏。如果你的孩子还没有准备好进入这种游戏环境，请耐心等待，让他们达到他们准备好的发展阶段。时间还很充足。\n\n**要有耐心:** 当孩子们第一次准备好玩有组织的游戏并被介绍给一个新游戏时，你可能需要非常耐心。很可能在你尝试玩游戏的前十次中，你的孩子会对所有的棋子感到很有趣，并且做很多与游戏无关的事情。这是一个过程。你的孩子需要熟悉游戏及其棋子，新鲜感需要逐渐消退。你会知道你的孩子何时准备好了，你的耐心是否得到了回报。\n\n**玩一玩:** 一开始，您的孩子可能真的没有输赢意识，也不明白他们的选择会带来什么不同。没关系。你们只是一起玩。随着时间的推移，随着游戏及其选择变得越来越熟悉，您的孩子将开始意识到他们的选择会带来什么不同，并且他们会关心这些不同。\n\n**有时数学是看不见的:** 策略游戏并不总是涉及数字部分，但它们无论如何都是数学的。任何策略游戏都提供许多重要的学习机会，有些是数学的，有些不是。如前所述，解决问题是这些游戏培养的技能中的重要技能。批判性思维和逻辑沟通也在发展。遵守规则和轮流做事对社交情感学习非常有益。",

  "4.1 Counting to 100": "步骤31：数到100",
  "**10's:** When your child's counting extends from 20 up to 100, the hard parts are the changes in 10's. Those are the parts to give special support and practice. Once your child knows the sequence of the 10's, it is usually very easy for them to fill in the changes in 1's. For example, they will quickly learn to count \"70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.\"\n\n**Skip count by 10's:** When your child gets stuck counting between 1 and 100, it is usually at a transition in 10's. Typical questions to help your child get unstuck are: \"What comes next after the 60's?\" or \"What comes before the 50's?\" Practice skip counting by 10's to help with this. If your child can produce the 10's from 0 to 100 forward and backward, then they will be ready to answer those questions about which 10's come next or before.\n\n**Use objects:** Make this counting have more meaning by practicing it using a large group of small objects, such as pebbles. Gather together 100 of these objects and put them in a big pile off to the side. As your child counts up from one, pull over one object at a time with each number and include it in the current group of objects. Each time a group of ten objects is formed, put that group together in a special tens area. As the numbers increase, the tens area will have more and more groups of tens. By the time your child is in the 50's, there should be five groups of ten and a small collection of left over ones.\n\nYou can also do this practice in reverse by starting with ten groups of tens and then taking away one at a time as your child counts down from 100.\n\n**Count both directions:** Children often become really good counting quickly and automatically upward from 1 to 100, but then have trouble counting in the opposite direction. Counting from 100 to 1 forces more thought about the 10's transitions and helps with understanding the numbers better in general.\n\n**100 number chart:** Having a ten by ten 100 number chart going from 1 to 100, or from 0 to 99, will help your child see the pattern of the numbers. It will make it particularly clear how the tens place stays the same for ten numbers and the ones place keeps changing.": "**10 的:** 当您的孩子从 20 数到 100 时，最难的部分是 10 的变化。这些是需要特别支持和练习的部分。一旦您的孩子知道了 10 的顺序，他们通常很容易填写 1 的变化。例如，他们会很快学会数“70、71、72、73、74、75、76、77、78、79”。\n\n**按 10 跳过计数:** 当您的孩子在 1 到 100 之间数数时遇到困难，通常是在 10 的过渡阶段。帮助您的孩子摆脱困境的典型问题是：“60 之后是什么？”或“50 之前是什么？”练习以 10 为单位跳过计数以帮助解决这个问题。如果您的孩子可以从 0 到 100 正向和反向数出 10，那么他们将准备好回答关于哪些 10 在下一个或之前的问题。\n\n**使用物体:** 通过使用一大堆小物体（如鹅卵石）进行练习，让计数更有意义。收集 100 个这样的物体，将它们堆放在一边。当您的孩子从一开始数数时，每次拉一个带有每个数字的物体，并将其包含在当前的物体组中。每当形成一组十个物体时，就将该组放在一个特殊的十位数区域。随着数字的增加，十位数区域将有越来越多的十位数组。等您的孩子数到 50 时，应该有五组十位数和一小堆剩余的个位数。\n\n您也可以反向练习，从十组十开始，然后随着您的孩子从 100 倒数，一次减去一个。\n\n**计算两个方向:** 孩子们通常能够快速而自如地从 1 数到 100，但反过来数却有困难。从 100 数到 1 会迫使他们更多地思考 10 的过渡，并有助于更好地理解数字。\n\n**100 数字图表:** 拥有一张从 1 到 100 或从 0 到 99 的十乘十 100 数字表，将帮助您的孩子看到数字的规律。它将特别清楚地说明十位数字保持不变，而个位数字不断变化。",
  "4.2 Two-Digit Place Value": "步骤32：两位数位值",
  "**Number meaning:** Seeing a two-digit number as some number of tens and ones is central to understanding and working with those numbers. Doing two-digit addition and subtraction requires fluency with the concepts of place value. Develop that understanding through lots of experiences with physical objects and written numbers.\n\n**Bundles of tens:** Take something you have lots of, make a large pile of it, and put some of them in a few bundles of ten. For example, out of that large pile ask your child to gather 23 of them. Then ask your child to group them in groups of ten. They will form two groups of ten and 3 singles. See what happens with the groups of ten in these 23 things as you put in some additional items or take some away, always making sure that there are no more than 9 single items at any time.\n\n**Expanded form:** The expanded form of a number is writing it as a sum of its place value parts. For example, 23 would be written as 20 + 3, and 256 would be written as 200 + 50 + 6. Practice with your child converting in both directions between a number's usual form and its expanded form. Point out that the expanded form of a number is the same as taking that many things and bundling them into groups of ten and have ones left over.\n\n**Counting with tick marks:** Counting using groups of five tick marks is a natural thing people like to do and is strongly related to place value. If you are counting 23 things with tick marks, you will end up with 4 bundles of 5 and 3 tick marks left over. Those 4 bundles of 5 can be reorganized as 2 bundles of 2 groups of 5, which is our expanded form view of 23.\n\n**Skip counting:** Skip counting by various numbers is a way to build mental practice with adding or subtracting single-digit and double-digit numbers. Although it is a great way to practice, this does require some mental steps that not every child will be ready for at this point – there is no hurry. Here are two examples. With lots of practice, these thinking steps will become automatic.\n\nSkip count upward by 8 starting at 23. Think of 23 as 20 plus 3 more. Using the number bonds for 10, 3 will need 7 more to make a group of 10. Use 7 out of the 8 being added so that 3 plus 7 forms another group of 10. So, 23 + 8 becomes 20 + 10 + 1, which is 31.\n\nSkip count downward by 5 starting at 23. Break up 5 into 3 and 2. To subtract 5, we will first take away 3 and then take away 2. 23 subtract 3 brings us to 20, which we will think of as 10 + 10. Subtracting the remaining 2 from one of those 10's leaves 8, so our answer is 10 + 8, which is 18.": "**数字含义:** 将两位数视为十位数和个位数是理解和使用这些数字的关键。进行两位数加减运算需要熟练掌握位值概念。通过大量使用实物和书面数字的经验来培养这种理解。\n\n**成捆的:** 拿出你有很多的东西，堆成一大堆，然后把其中的一些分成几捆，每捆十个。例如，让您的孩子从那一大堆中收集 23 件。然后让您的孩子将它们分成十个一组。它们将形成两组，每组十件，每组三件。看看当你放入一些额外的物品或拿走一些物品时，这 23 件物品中的十个组会发生什么情况，始终确保任何时候的单件物品不超过 9 件。\n\n**展开形式:** 数字的展开形式是将其写为其位值部分的总和。例如，23 可以写为 20 + 3，256 可以写为 200 + 50 + 6。与您的孩子一起练习在数字的正常形式和展开形式之间进行双向转换。指出数字的展开形式与将那么多东西捆成十个一组并剩下个数相同。\n\n**用刻度线计数:** 使用 5 个刻度线组进行计数是人们喜欢做的一件自然的事情，并且与位值密切相关。如果您用刻度线计数 23 个东西，那么您最终会得到 4 捆 5 个东西和 3 个剩余的刻度线。这 4 捆 5 个东西可以重新组织成 2 捆 2 组 5 个东西，这就是我们对 23 的扩展形式视图。\n\n**跳过计数:** 跳过各种数字的计数是一种通过加减一位数和两位数来建立心理练习的方法。虽然这是一种很好的练习方法，但这确实需要一些心理步骤，并不是每个孩子现在都准备好了——不必着急。以下是两个例子。经过大量练习，这些思考步骤将成为自动化的。\n\n从 23 开始，每次向上跳数 8。将 23 视为 20 加上 3。使用 10 的数字键，3 需要再加 7 才能组成 10 组。使用所加 8 中的 7，这样 3 加 7 就形成另一个 10 组。因此，23 + 8 变成 20 + 10 + 1，即 31。\n\n从 23 开始，每次向下跳过 5 个数。将 5 分成 3 和 2。要减去 5，我们首先要减去 3，然后减去 2。23 减去 3 得到 20，我们将其视为 10 + 10。从其中一个 10 中减去剩下的 2 得到 8，所以我们的答案是 10 + 8，也就是 18。",
  "4.3 Finger Addition The Easy Way": "步骤33：添加手指",
  "**Counting On using fingers:** Any single-digit number can be added to any number using this method. This uses the child's hands to keep track of the single-digit number that is being added. It makes use of Counting On to find the final total, and also your child's skill with recognizing quantities of fingers.\n\n**Example:** Use 8 + 7 as an example. We could use either number as the number we start with, but it will be quicker and less work if we start with the larger number, which is 8 in this case. Start with no fingers raised and both hands in a closed fist. Your child is going to count starting at 8, and each time a new number is mentioned, your child will raise another finger. So, starting with \"8\" with no fingers raised, the child Counts On and says \"9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\" while raising one more finger each time. Your child will stop at 15 because they will recognize they have 7 fingers raised at that point.\n\n**Any starting number:** Notice that your child can use this method with any starting number. This example would have worked just as easily for adding 58 + 7.\n\n**It is reliable, but it will be replaced:** This will eventually be replaced by other methods, but for now this is reliable and is something your child can be assured will always give them the right answer any time they need it.": "**用手指计数:** 使用此方法可以将任何一位数加到任何数字上。这种方法使用孩子的手来跟踪要添加的一位数。它利用计数来找到最终总数，以及您的孩子识别手指数量的技能。\n\n**例子:** 以 8 + 7 为例。我们可以使用任意一个数字作为起始数字，但如果我们从较大的数字开始，即本例中的 8，那么速度会更快，工作量也会更少。开始时不要举起手指，双手握拳。您的孩子将从 8 开始数数，每次提到一个新数字时，您的孩子都会举起另一根手指。因此，从“8”开始，不举起手指，孩子继续数数，说“9、10、11、12、13、14、15”，同时每次多举起一根手指。您的孩子会在 15 处停止，因为他们会意识到自己在那时已经举起了 7 根手指。\n\n**任意起始数字:** 请注意，您的孩子可以将该方法用于任何起始数字。此示例同样适用于 58 + 7 的加法。\n\n**它很可靠，但将被取代:** 这种方法最终将被其他方法取代，但就目前而言，它是可靠的，并且可以确保您的孩子在需要时始终能得到正确的答案。",
  "4.4 Finger Subtraction The Easy Way": "步骤34：手指减法",
  "**Two subtractions:** The two models for subtraction, take away and difference, are both important and both need to be practiced. Here are methods that use a child's hands to keep track of part of the calculation. As with finger addition using fingers, these methods use your child's skill with recognizing quantities of fingers. We'll use 14 - 8 as our example for both methods.\n\n**Take away with fingers:** This method uses counting down to take away a single-digit number from any number. Have your child start with two closed fists and say \"14.\" Counting down from 14, your child raises one more finger with each new number: \"13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.\" Your child will stop at 6 when they see they have 8 fingers raised.\n\n**Difference with fingers:** This method uses Counting On to find a single-digit difference between any two numbers.

  "4.5 Compensation for Add and Subtract": "步骤35：加减补偿",
  "**Useful and easier than you think:** Compensation is a useful mental arithmetic tool for simplifying addition and subtraction calculations of all sizes. Understanding it also increases number sense for addition and subtraction. It is simpler than it sounds.\n\nFor example, suppose you were adding 99 + 15. You would recognize that 99 needs just one more to make 100, a number that is much easier to work with than 99. So you would move 1 from the 15 to the 99 – you would have the same total number of things, but they are distributed in a way that's easier to work with. This problem becomes 100 + 14, which is very easy to do. This is the kind of thing we'll be doing.\n\n**Compensation for addition:** The idea is to give or take some small amount to make one of the numbers easier to work with. We will typically be making one of the numbers into a multiple of 10. Suppose you are adding 8 + 7. The 8 just needs 2 more to become 10, so take that 2 away from the 7. This makes 8 + 7 into 10 + 5, which is easy. We could also have done this problem by giving 3 to the 7 to make it 10. In that case, we'd turn 8 + 7 into 5 + 10.\n\n**More compensation for addition:** There are other possibilities for using compensation in addition problems. Consider 6 + 8 for example. The 6 could give 2 to the 8 to make this problem 4 + 10. However, the 8 could give 1 to the 6 to make this 7 + 7, an adding twins problem. Challenge each other to think of different ways for doing a given adding problem.\n\n**Compensation for subtraction:** For subtraction, we will add the same amount or subtract the same amount from both numbers. This will keep the distance between them the same but will make them easier to work with. Typically that will mean turning the number we're subtracting into a multiple of 10. Suppose we are subtracting 13 - 8. If we add 2 to both numbers, then the distance between stays the same, but now we are subtracting 15 - 10, which is easy. Similarly, if we were asked to do 17 - 13, we could subtract 3 from both numbers and turn it into 14 - 10. Alternatively, we could subtract 10 from both numbers and turn it into 7 - 3.": "**比你想象的更实用、更简单:** 补偿是一种有用的心算工具，可以简化各种大小的加减运算。理解它还可以提高加减运算的数字感。它比听起来简单得多。\n\n例如，假设您要将 99 + 15 相加。您会发现 99 只需再加 1 即可得到 100，而 100 比 99 更容易处理。因此，您需要将 1 从 15 移到 99 —— 这样一来，总数将保持不变，但它们的分布方式更容易处理。这个问题变成了 100 + 14，这很容易做到。这就是我们要做的事情。\n\n**加减补偿:** 其思想是增加或减少一些小数，使其中一个数字更容易处理。我们通常会将其中一个数字变成 10 的倍数。假设您要将 8 + 7 相加。8 只需再增加 2 即可变成 10，因此从 7 中减去 2。这样 8 + 7 就变成 10 + 5，这很容易。我们也可以通过将 3 加到 7 上使其成为 10 来解决这个问题。在这种情况下，我们会将 8 + 7 变成 5 + 10。\n\n**更多附加补偿:** 在加法问题中，还有其他使用补偿的可能性。以 6 + 8 为例。6 可以将 8 的乘积减去 2，使这个问题变成 4 + 10。但是，8 可以将 6 的乘积减去 1，使这个问题变成 7 + 7，这是一个加法双胞胎问题。挑战彼此，想出解决给定加法问题的不同方法。\n\n**补偿减法:** 对于减法，我们将从两个数字中加上或减去相同的量。这将保持它们之间的距离相同，但会使它们更容易处理。通常，这意味着将我们要减去的数字变成 10 的倍数。假设我们要减去 13 - 8。如果我们将 2 加到两个数字上，那么它们之间的距离保持不变，但现在我们要减去 15 - 10，这很容易。同样，如果我们被要求做 17 - 13，我们可以从两个数字中减去 3，然后将其变成 14 - 10。或者，我们可以从两个数字中减去 10，然后将其变成 7 - 3。",
  "4.6 10 as a Midway Point": "步骤36：10 作为中间点",
  "**Number bonds for 10:** The number 10 is often a handy mental arithmetic midway point to use for doing addition and subtraction problems that involve numbers above 10. Your child should have a strong command of the number bonds for 10 to take full advantage of these methods.\n\n**Addition sums over 10:** Suppose your child is given the addition problem 5 + 7. The number bond for 10 using 7 is 3, so your child can use 3 of the 5 to get to 10. The remaining 2 of the 5 will bring the total to 12. The point was to break up the 5 into two pieces, 3 and 2 – one which got the 7 to 10, and the other gets added onto the 10. This problem could also have been done the other way. The 7 could have been broken up into 5 and 2 – the 5 would be added to the original 5 to get 10, and then the 2 would be added to 10 to get 12.\n\nNotice that this is similar to the thinking for doing addition compensation.\n\n**Subtracting from a number bigger than 10:** Let's use 12 - 7 as our example. We can do this as a take away or a difference problem.\n\nAs a take away problem, we'll use 2 of the 7 to get 12 down to 10. We then have 5 of the 7 left to take the 10 down to 5. We broke 7 into 2 and 5 to be able to use 10 as an intermediate stop along the way.\n\nAs a difference problem, the total distance between 12 and 7 is the distance between 12 and 10 plus the distance between 10 and 7. The distance between 12 and 10 is 2, and the distance from 10 and 7 is 3, so the total distance is 2 plus 3, which is 5.": "**10 的分解组合:** 数字 10 通常是一个方便的心算中间点，用于解决涉及 10 以上的数字的加减问题。您的孩子应该熟练掌握 10 的数字键，才能充分利用这些方法。\n\n**10 以上的加法:** 假设您的孩子要解决加法问题 5 + 7。用 7 得到 10 的数字组合是 3，因此您的孩子可以使用 5 中的 3 得到 10。剩下的 5 中的 2 将使总数达到 12。关键是将 5 分成两部分，3 和 2 - 一部分将 7 加到 10，另一部分加到 10 上。这道题也可以用另一种方式来解决。7 可以分成 5 和 2 - 5 加到原来的 5 得到 10，然后 2 加到 10 得到 12。\n\n注意，这与做加法补偿的思路类似。\n\n**从大于 10 的数字中减去:** 让我们以 12 - 7 为例。我们可以将其作为一道带走题或差分题来做。\n\n作为一个带走的问题，我们将使用 7 中的 2 将 12 减少到 10。然后我们用剩下的 7 中的 5 将 10 减少到 5。我们将 7 分成 2 和 5，以便能够使用 10 作为沿途的中间站。\n\n作为差分问题，12 和 7 之间的总距离为 12 和 10 之间的距离加上 10 和 7 之间的距离。12 和 10 之间的距离为 2，10 和 7 之间的距离为 3，因此总距离为 2 加 3，即 5。",

The two easiest ones are skip counting by 5's and 10's.\n\n**By 10's:** Not only is skip counting by 10's easy to do, it also provides practice with place value. Your child will quickly realize that, if they skip count by 10's starting at 3, all the numbers will have a 3 in the ones place and the only thing that changes is the tens place. If you have a 100 chart available, use it to show your child that all the numbers go down or up in one column of the chart.\n\n**By 5's:** After your child masters skip counting by 10's, it is time to do the 5's. When your child skip counts by 5's, they will be comforted to see that every other number is 10 apart, as if they were skip counting by 10's.\n\n**Experiment with others:** There is no hurry to do the other numbers.

  "4.10 Strategy Games II": "步骤40：策略游戏II",
  "**The value of these games:** Strategy games are games where the players have choices that produce better or worse outcomes. These games have a lot to offer children mathematically, even when there is no explicit numerical content. In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving.\n\n**An introduction to Nim:** Now that your child has been playing strategy games for a while, it is time to look into how to get more out of them. Let's use the game of Nim as an example. This game has some very simple rules: Pick a starting number, say 10, and a person to go first. Players alternate turns choosing to subtract 1 or 2 from the running total. The person who reaches 0 wins. The arithmetic is simple enough, but the strategy is challenging.\n\n**Learning from experience:** If you imagine you are playing any game against an extremely capable opponent, the game becomes a puzzle. How can I find the move that let's me have my best chance of winning no matter how well my opponent plays? One strategy is to play the game many times and pay attention to what seems to work and what doesn't. This approach is a good start and it does provide the opportunity for observation and insights. This can be a slow method of learning, and it may be very hard to find patterns in complicated games – imagine all the possibilities if we picked the starting number of 100 for Nim!\n\n**Solving Nim:** Can we look ahead a few moves and figure out good moves that way? That is hard to do starting at 10. If we start at 5, it's pretty easy to do. If we subtract 2, the new number will be 3. No matter whether the other play subtracts 1 or 2 at this point, we will win. So, if we are at the number 5, we know how to win. What happens with other small starting numbers? Can we find a pattern that will tell us which starting numbers will be winners and which will be losers? Can we explain why that pattern is true?\n\n**The goal:** If we follow this line of attack, we will completely solve how to play the game of Nim. What worked for Nim may or may not work for another game. This is problem solving, and each new problem can bring fresh challenges and a need for new ideas. And that is the fun. Share this attitude of puzzling and being challenged to your child. As they play a strategy game, discuss with them their ideas about what would make for a better or worse move at that moment. The point isn't so much to find the perfect move as it is to enjoy looking for it and having a discussion about it with people who they can enjoy sharing ideas with.": "**这些游戏的价值:** 策略游戏是玩家可以选择更好或更坏结果的游戏。这些游戏在数学方面为孩子们提供了许多东西，即使没有明确的数字内容。特别是，它们自然而然地激励孩子们解决问题。\n\n**尼姆游戏简介:** 现在您的孩子已经玩策略游戏一段时间了，是时候研究如何从中获得更多乐趣了。让我们以 尼姆游戏为例。这个游戏有一些非常简单的规则：选择一个起始数字，比如 10，然后选择一个人先走。玩家轮流选择从累计总数中减去 1 或 2。减去 0 的人获胜。算术很简单，但策略很有挑战性。\n\n**从经验中学习:** 如果你想象自己正在与一个非常有能力的对手玩游戏，那么游戏就会变成一个难题。无论对手玩得多好，我如何才能找到让我有最大获胜机会的举动？一种策略是多次玩游戏，并注意哪些似乎有效，哪些无效。这种方法是一个很好的开始，它确实提供了观察和洞察的机会。这可能是一种缓慢的学习方法，而且在复杂的游戏中可能很难找到模式——想象一下，如果我们为 尼姆游戏选择的起始数字是 100，那么所有的可能性！\n\n**解决尼姆游戏:** 我们能否预测几步并以此找出好的举动？从 10 开始很难做到这一点。如果我们从 5 开始，这很容易做到。如果我们减去 2，新的数字将是 3。无论此时对方是减去 1 还是 2，我们都会赢。所以，如果我们处于数字 5，我们就知道如何取胜。其他较小的起始数字会发生什么？我们能否找到一种模式来告诉我们哪些起始数字会赢，哪些会输？我们能解释为什么这种模式是正确的吗？\n\n**目标:** 如果我们遵循这条攻击路线，我们将完全解决如何玩 尼姆游戏的问题。对尼姆游戏有效的方法可能对其他游戏也有效，也可能无效。这就是解决问题的方法，每个新问题都会带来新的挑战和对新想法的需求。这就是乐趣所在。向您的孩子分享这种困惑和接受挑战的态度。当他们玩策略游戏时，与他们讨论他们的想法，看看在那一刻什么会更好或更坏。重点不在于找到完美的举动，而是享受寻找它并与可以与他们分享想法的人讨论它。",

  "5.1 3-Digit Place Value": "步骤41：3位数",
  "**Many objects:** Relating math concepts to physical objects is often the best approach for young children. The difficulty here is that it is not so easy to have hundreds of objects in the first place, and it can also be unwieldy to deal with such a large collection. In addition to having groups of ones and tens of some object, one strategy is to use symbolic place holders for large groups, such as 100s. You could have several pieces of paper or wood on which you have written \"100.\"\n\n**Use objects:** Practice having your child represent various quantities using objects grouped in ones, tens, and hundreds. For example, ask how 325 would be represented using these objects. Include examples such as 206, 430, and 500 that have zero things in one or more categories. Also, lay out collections of ones, tens, and hundreds and ask your child to name the number for this quantity.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Once your child is thoroughly comfortable with the connection between numbers and their quantities, start using numerals and expanded form to represent the numbers. Take a number, such as 325, for example. Represent it with quantities for hundreds, tens, and ones, and then use the quantity representation to write the number in expanded form as 325 = 300 + 20 + 5. Do this same practice in the opposite direction by writing 100 + 40 + 6, representing it with physical groups of hundreds, tens, and ones of objects, and then asking what the total number is.": "**许多物体:** 对于年幼的孩子来说，将数学概念与实物联系起来往往是最好的方法。这里的困难在于，一开始就很难拥有数百个物体，而且处理如此庞大的集合也很麻烦。除了拥有一组个数和十个个数的物体外，一种策略是使用符号占位符来表示大组，例如 100 个。你可以准备几张纸或木头，上面写上“100”。\n\n**使用物体:** 练习让您的孩子使用按个位数、十位数和百位数分组的物体来表示各种数量。例如，询问如何使用这些物体表示 325。包括 206、430 和 500 等示例，这些示例在一个或多个类别中没有东西。此外，列出个位数、十位数和百位数的集合，并让您的孩子说出这个数量的数字。\n\n**使用扩展形式:** 一旦您的孩子完全理解了数字和数量之间的联系，就可以开始使用数字和扩展形式来表示数字。以 325 为例。用百位数、十位数和个位数表示它，然后使用数量表示法以扩展形式写出数字，即 325 = 300 + 20 + 5。以相反的方向进行同样的练习，写出 100 + 40 + 6，用物体的百位数、十位数和个位数的物理组来表示它，然后询问总数是多少。",
  "5.2 Double-Digit Add and Subtract": "步骤42：两位数加/减",
  "**Single digit:** A gentle introduction to working with two two-digit numbers is to have one of them be a single-digit number. One of the best ways to practice adding or subtracting a single-digit number with a double-digit number is to do skip counting using various skip sizes, going up or down, and starting at any number. The following methods for two two-digit numbers will of course work when one of the numbers is a single-digit number.\n\n**Use objects:** Grounding your child's understanding by using physical objects is always a good idea. Start by representing both of the numbers with groups of tens and ones.\n\n**Adding:** If you are adding the two numbers, put all the groups together and discuss the result. If you are adding two numbers, such as 23 and 45, that is all you need to do. However, if you are adding 23 and 48, the two groups of ones form at least a group of ten. Talk about how that changes the total number of tens you have from 6 to 7. This is called regrouping.\n\n**Subtracting:** If you are subtracting, start by removing the tens being subtracted from the bigger number and then attempt to remove the appropriate number of ones. For example, if you are subtracting 23 from 45, then there are enough ones and you are done. If there are not enough ones, such as if you are subtracting 28 from 45, then discuss how one of the groups of tens needs to be broken up and included with the ones. The original grouping of 45 as 4 tens and 5 ones becomes a grouping of 3 tens and 15 ones. This is also called regrouping.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Use objects for double-digit adding and subtracting until your child thoroughly understands the process and why regrouping makes sense when it is needed. At this point, move to representing the adding and subtracting with numbers written in expanded form. When working with numbers in expanded form, the process and the steps are exactly the same as they were when you were working with groups of tens and ones – and that is the point.\n\n**Making it automatic:** Over time and with lots of practice, your child will stop needing to use groups of tens and ones or expanded form. However, as with so many other things, there is no hurry getting to that point – it will come with practice.": "**个位数:** 简单介绍一下如何操作两个两位数，其中一个是单数。练习用两位数加或减一位数的最佳方法之一是使用各种跳跃大小进行跳跃计数，向上或向下，从任意数字开始。当其中一个数字是单数时，以下两个两位数的方法当然有效。\n\n**使用物体:** 使用实物来巩固孩子的理解始终是一个好主意。首先用十位数和个位数来表示这两个数字。\n\n**添加:** 如果要将两个数字相加，请将所有数字组合在一起并讨论结果。如果要将两个数字相加，例如 23 和 45，那么只需这样做即可。但是，如果要将 23 和 48 相加，那么两组 1 至少会形成一组 10。讨论一下这会如何将您拥有的 10 的总数从 6 变为 7。这称为重组。\n\n**减法:** 如果要减法，首先从较大的数字中减去要减去的十位，然后尝试减去适当数量的个位。例如，如果要从 45 中减去 23，那么个位就足够了，您就完成了。如果个位不够，例如要从 45 中减去 28，那么讨论如何将十位组中的一组拆分并包含在个位中。45 的原始分组为 4 个十位和 5 个个位，变为 3 个十位和 15 个个位。这也称为重新分组。\n\n**使用扩展形式:** 使用物体进行两位数加减运算，直到您的孩子彻底理解该过程以及为什么在需要时重新分组是有意义的。此时，转到用展开形式的数字表示加减运算。当使用展开形式的数字时，过程和步骤与使用十位数和个位数组时完全相同 - 这就是重点。\n\n**实现自动化:** 随着时间的推移和大量的练习，你的孩子将不再需要使用十位和个位或扩展形式。然而，就像其他许多事情一样，不必着急达到这一点——它会随着练习而来。",

  "**Practice:** Practice skip counting up and down starting anywhere and by any number from 2 to 10. Not surprisingly, this is valuable for learning multiplication and division. It is also very helpful for getting better at mental addition and subtraction. One of the nice things about skip counting is that it can be done anywhere and at any time that you have some spare time.\n\n**Patterns on a 100 chart:** Look for patterns that show up as your child skip counts. This is most easily done using a 100 chart, but you can also do it by writing the numbers in a column and watching what happens to the ones and tens digits as they march down the column. Some numbers, such as 8 and 9, have interesting patterns in their ones digits, and other numbers, such as 3, are not as interesting.\n\n**Make it fun:** This is something you can make into an activity to do with two or more people. Someone says a number to start with, what the skip size will be, and whether to go up or down. Then go around the group with each person saying the next skip count number.": "**实践:** 练习从任意位置开始，以 2 到 10 之间的任意数字为单位进行上下跳数。这对于学习乘法和除法非常有用，这并不奇怪。它对于提高心算加减法也很有帮助。跳数的好处之一是，只要你有空闲时间，就可以在任何地方、任何时间进行。\n\n**100 图表上的模式:** 寻找孩子跳过计数时出现的规律。使用 100 图表最容易做到这一点，但您也可以通过将数字写在一列中并观察个位和十位数字在列中向下移动时发生的情况来做到这一点。有些数字（例如 8 和 9）的个位数字有有趣的规律，而其他数字（例如 3）则不那么有趣。\n\n**让事情变得有趣:** 你可以把这个活动做成两人或多人一起做。一个人说出一个数字，然后跳多远，并说明是往上跳还是往下跳。然后让每个人轮流说出下一个跳数。",

  "**Good framework:** These numbers are usually quick to learn, and once learned they provide a good framework for learning the remaining numbers.\n\n**Multiplying by 5 and 10:** Knowing how to multiply by 10 is quick to learn, and it is important for understanding place value. It also can make it easier to learn how to multiply by 5.\n\nThe 5's can either be learned by skip counting by 5 until they become automatic, or they can be learned using the 10's. If you multiply 6 times 5, that will give you half as many 10's. Half of 6 is 3, so the answer is 30. If you multiply 7 times 5, you need to put one of the 5's off to the side and proceed as you would for 6 times 5. The answer for 6 times 5 is 30, and then adding in the 5 held in reserve gives the answer of 35.\n\n**Multiplying by 2, 4, and 8:** These three can be done with lots of doubling. Your child should have had lots of practice with doubling and multiplying by 2. Multiply by 4 either by skip counting or by doubling the answer from multiplying by 2. For example 4 times 3 is twice as much as 2 x 3, so the answer is 6 doubled, which is 12. Multiply by 8 by skip counting by 8 or by doubling the answer from multiplying by 4.": "**良好的框架:** 这些数字通常很容易学，而且一旦学会，它们就可以为学习剩余的数字提供一个很好的框架。\n\n**乘以 5 和 10:** 学会如何乘以 10 很容易，这对于理解位值很重要。它还可以使学习如何乘以 5 变得更容易。\n\n5 可以通过跳过 5 的计数来学习，直到它们成为自动的，或者可以使用 10 来学习。如果你将 6 乘以 5，那么你将得到 10 的一半。6 的一半是 3，所以答案是 30。如果你将 7 乘以 5，你需要将其中一个 5 放在一边，然后像 6 乘以 5 那样继续。6 乘以 5 的答案是 30，然后加上保留的 5 得到答案 35。\n\n**乘以 2、4 和 8:** 这三项可以通过多次加倍来完成。您的孩子应该已经练习过多次加倍和乘以 2。乘以 4 可以通过跳过计数或将乘以 2 的答案加倍来实现。例如，4 乘以 3 是 2 x 3 的两倍，因此答案是 6 的两倍，即 12。乘以 8 可以通过跳过计数 8 或将乘以 4 的答案加倍来实现。",
  "5.5 Multiplying by 3, 4, 6, 9, and 11": "步骤45：乘法 - 3、4、6、9、11",
  "**Several strategies:** These are grouped here because they can be done with the idea of using one more or one less, which is described in a moment. However, several of these can be done in other ways. They can all be done with skip counting, if your child prefers that approach. Multiplying by 4 is the double of multiplying by 2. Multiplying by 6 is the double of multiplying by 3. Multiplying by 11 is quite simple and barely needs any practice.\n\nMultiplying by 9 has a special rule, that some children enjoy. Use 6 times 9 as an example. For the answer, put one less than the number in the tens place (which is 5), and subtract the tens place from 9 to get the ones place (which is 4). So 6 times 9 is 54. As you'll see, this is no different than subtracting 6 from 6 times 10, but somehow it feels like more fun.\n\n**One more and one less:** Use the idea of one more or one less to learn these based on other numbers you now know how to multiply by. The numbers 3, 6, and 11 are one more than numbers you already know. For example, 6 times 7 is one more 7 than 5 times 7. So 6 times 7 is 7 + 35, which is 42.\n\nThe numbers 4 and 9 are one less than numbers you already know. For example, 4 times 7 is one less 7 than 5 times 7. So 4 times 7 is 35 - 7, which is 28.": "**几种策略:** 这些被归类在这里是因为它们可以通过多一或少一的方法来做，稍后会介绍。但是，其中一些可以用其他方式来完成。如果您的孩子喜欢这种方法，它们都可以用跳数来完成。乘以 4 是乘以 2 的两倍。乘以 6 是乘以 3 的两倍。乘以 11 非常简单，几乎不需要任何练习。\n\n乘以 9 有一个特殊规则，有些孩子很喜欢。以 6 乘以 9 为例。答案是，在十位上放置一个比数字少的数字（即 5），然后用 9 减去十位得到个位（即 4）。所以 6 乘以 9 等于 54。正如你所见，这与从 6 乘以 10 中减去 6 没什么不同，但不知何故感觉更有趣。\n\n**多一个，少一个:** 使用多一或少一的思想，根据你现在知道如何乘以的其他数字来学习这些。数字 3、6 和 11 比你已经知道的数字多一。例如，6 乘以 7 比 5 乘以 7 多一个 7。所以 6 乘以 7 等于 7 + 35，也就是 42。\n\n4 和 9 比您已知的数字少 1。例如，4 乘以 7 比 5 乘以 7 少 1。因此 4 乘以 7 等于 35 - 7，也就是 28。",

Keep all this practice light-hearted and do not get too goal oriented.\n\n**Pulling it all together and memorizing:** Bit by bit, with practice and repeated exposure, your child will memorize all the multiplication facts. While it is important that these eventually become easy and automatic for your child, it is not essential that this happens quickly.

  "5.7 Divisors, Factors, and Multiples": "步骤47：除数、因数和倍数",
  "**Divisors and factors:** If a number evenly divides into a number, then it is called a divisor of it. For example, 3 is a divisor of 6 because 3 divides into 6 exactly 2 times. 4 is not a divisor by 6 because it goes into it 1 1/2 times. The word factor means the same thing as divisor.\n\n**Common divisors:** In some mathematical situations, particularly with simplifying fractions, it is useful to find numbers that evenly divide two given numbers. Such numbers are called common divisors or common factors. The common divisors of 20 and 8 are 1, 2, and 4. You may enjoy exploring together why all the common divisors for a pair of numbers are divisors of the greatest of the common divisors.\n\n**Multiples:** A multiple of a number is anything that can be produced by multiplying the number by a whole number. For example, some multiples of 6 are 0, 6, 12, and 18. Notice that any multiple of a number has that number as a divisor. For example, each of the multiples of 6 has 6 as a divisor.\n\n**Common multiples:** A number which is a multiple of two given numbers is said to be a common multiple for them. Some common multiples of 6 and 4 are 0, 12, 24, and 36. Notice that all the common multiples are multiples of the least of the positive common multiples. Common multiples will be useful in adding and subtracting fractions.\n\n**Introduce these words:** Slowly introduce these new words to your child as you discuss situations that involve multiplication and division. They are useful words that simplify many discussions once the words are understood.": "**除数和约数:** 如果一个数能整除另一个数，那么它就被称为该数的约数。例如，3 是 6 的约数，因为 3 能整除 6 的 2 次。4 不能整除 6，因为它能整除 6 的 1 1/2 次。因数与约数含义相同。\n\n**公约数:** 在某些数学情况下，特别是在简化分数时，找到可以整除两个给定数字的数字很有用。这样的数字称为公约数或公因数。20 和 8 的公约数是 1、2 和 4。您可能会喜欢一起探索为什么一对数字的所有公约数都是最大公约数的公约数。\n\n**倍数:** 一个数的倍数是该数与一个整数相乘后得到的数。例如，6 的一些倍数是 0、6、12 和 18。请注意，任何数的倍数都以该数为除数。例如，6 的每个倍数都以 6 为除数。\n\n**公倍数:** 如果一个数是两个给定数的倍数，则称该数为这两个数的公倍数。6 和 4 的一些公倍数是 0、12、24 和 36。请注意，所有公倍数都是最小正公倍数的倍数。公倍数在加减分数时很有用。\n\n**介绍这些词:** 在讨论涉及乘法和除法的情况时，慢慢向孩子介绍这些新词。一旦理解了这些词，它们就很有用，可以简化许多讨论。",
  "5.8 Primes, Composites, and Powers": "步骤48：素数、合数和幂",
  "**Primes:** Primes are central to understanding multiplication and division of whole numbers. As you will see, primes are the building blocks of numbers using multiplication. A prime number is a number larger than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and itself. The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are the first few prime numbers.\n\n**Composites and 1:** There are three kinds of positive whole numbers: 1 (which is called a unit), primes, and composites. Composites can be thought of as being constructed from primes. For example, 12 is 2 times 2 times 3. Every number larger than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely written as a product of two or more primes.\n\n**Prime factorizations:** Getting to know prime factorizations really well will be very helpful for many parts of the math your child is about to learn. Repeating the prime factorizations of the numbers up to 20, or even 30, is a good exercize for getting to know these factorizations. Simply go through the list of numbers in order like this: 1 - unit, 2 - prime, 3 - prime, 4 - 2 times 2, 5 - prime, 6 - 2 times 3, 7 - prime, 8 - 2 times 2 times 2, 9 - 3 times 3, and 10 - 2 times 5.\n\n**Powers:** Prime factorizations often involve repeated prime factors, so this is a good time to learn about powers and to practice them. It is quicker and easier to understand to say \"2 to the fourth\" than it is to say \"2 times 2 times 2 times 2.\" 2 squared means 2 times 2, and 2 cubed means 2 times 2 times 2.": "**素数:** 素数对于理解整数的乘法和除法至关重要。如你所见，素数是使用乘法的数字的构成要素。素数是大于 1 的数字，其唯一除数是 1 和它本身。数字 2、3、5、7 和 11 是前几个素数。\n\n**合数和 1:** 正整数有三种：1（称为单位）、质数和合数。合数可以看作是由质数构成的。例如，12 是 2 乘以 2 乘以 3。每个大于 1 的数字要么是质数，要么可以唯一地写成两个或多个质数的乘积。\n\n**质因数分解:** 真正了解质因数分解对您的孩子即将学习的数学的许多部分都非常有帮助。重复对数字进行质因数分解，直到 20 甚至 30，是了解这些因数分解的一个很好的练习。只需按以下顺序浏览数字列表：1 - 单位，2 - 质数，3 - 质数，4 - 2 乘以 2，5 - 质数，6 - 2 乘以 3，7 - 质数，8 - 2 乘以 2 乘以 2，9 - 3 乘以 3，10 - 2 乘以 5。\n\n**幂:** 质因数分解通常涉及重复的质因数，因此这是学习幂并练习幂的好时机。说“2 的四次方”比说“2 乘以 2 乘以 2 乘以 2”更快、更容易理解。2 的平方意味着 2 乘以 2，2 的立方意味着 2 乘以 2 乘以 2。",
  "**Factors and factor trees:** For larger numbers, it may not be immediately obvious what the prime factorization is. For these numbers, find one of the factors and use that to break apart the problem into easier pieces. For example, 54 is 9 times 6. Because 9 is 3 squared and 6 is 2 times 3, we can put those together to have 54 is 2 times 3 cubed. This process is sometimes called making a factor tree, and pictured above are three possible ways for creating a factor tree for 54.": "**因子和因子树:** 对于较大的数字，质因数分解可能不是立即显而易见的。对于这些数字，找到其中一个因数，并利用它将问题分解成更简单的部分。例如，54 是 9 乘以 6。因为 9 是 3 的平方，而 6 是 2 乘以 3，所以我们可以将它们放在一起得到 54 是 2 乘以 3 的立方。这个过程有时被称为制作因数树，上图是创建 54 的因数树的三种可能方法。",
  "5.9 Fact Families II": "步骤49：事实家族II",
  "**Families:** In Stage 3 we explored the fact families that connect addition and subtraction, and we saw how useful they are in understanding the interconnections between those two operations. Similar to what was done for addition and subtraction, group multiplication and division facts by families to gain a deeper understanding of them. For example, 3 x 4 = 12, 4 x 3 = 12, 12 / 3 = 4, and 12 / 4 = 3 form a fact family.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing are related:** For the 3 x 4 = 12 fact family, visualize this interconnection using a rectangle that is 3 by 4. The area of this rectangle is 12, which is 3 times 4 or 4 times 3 – its width times its length. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of width 3, the length must be 4. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of length 4, its width must be 3. All these facts are tied together.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing undo each other:** Let's continue to use the example of 3 times 4. If we start with 3 and multiply it by 4 we arrive at 12. If we then take 12 and divide it by 4, the result is back to 3. Multiplying by 4 and then dividing by 4 gets back to where we started.\n\nSimilarly, if we take 12 and divide by 4 the answer is 3. If we then multiply 3 by 4 the answer is 12, which is where we started. Dividing by 4 and then multiplying by 4 returns things to the beginning.": "**家庭:** 在第 3 阶段，我们探索了连接加法和减法的事实系列，并看到了它们对于理解这两个运算之间的相互联系有多大用处。与对加法和减法所做的类似，将乘法和除法事实按系列分组，以加深对它们的理解。例如，3 x 4 = 12、4 x 3 = 12、12 / 3 = 4 和 12 / 4 = 3 形成一个事实系列。\n\n**乘法和除法是相关的:** 对于 3 x 4 = 12 这一事实系列，使用一个 3 x 4 的矩形来形象化这种相互联系。这个矩形的面积是 12，即 3 乘以 4 或 4 乘以 3（即其宽度乘以长度）。要得到宽度为 3 的矩形的面积为 12，其长度必须为 4。要得到长度为 4 的矩形的面积为 12，其宽度必须为 3。所有这些事实都联系在一起。\n\n**乘法和除法互相抵消:** 我们继续使用 3 乘以 4 的例子。如果我们从 3 开始并将其乘以 4，则结果为 12。如果我们随后将 12 除以 4，结果又回到 3。乘以 4 然后除以 4 又回到我们开始的位置。\n\n类似地，如果我们取 12 并除以 4，答案是 3。如果我们再将 3 乘以 4，答案是 12，也就是我们开始的地方。除以 4 然后乘以 4 会回到开始的地方。",
  "5.10 Single-Digit Division": "步骤50：一位数除法",
  "**You have prepared the way:** Your work with skip counting, learning multiplication facts, and fact families will smooth the way for dividing both with and without remainders. All those skills should be well mastered and understood before starting in on general single-digit division.\n\n**No remainder:** Division problems where the divisor goes in evenly without a remainder are mostly done by your child recognizing the corresponding multiplication fact. For example, if they are asked to divide 36 by 4, then remembering that 4 times 9 is 36 will get them straight to the answer. However, if that method doesn't work for a given problem, then they should use the next method.\n\n**Guessing and skip counting:** Suppose your child is asked to divide 29 by 4. Your child will not find 29 among their multiplication facts involving 4, so they will want to find a result that is less than 29 that does work. Have your child guess at a multiple of 4 that is less than 29. They might guess 24, which is 4 times 6. They can then skip count forward until they bump into 29. In this case that will mean moving forward to 28, which is 4 times 7. Seeing that they have to stop there, they have their answer that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n\n**Checking the answer:** Checking their answers is a good habit for your child to develop. In this last example, we think we found that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1. Check this by multiplying 4 times 7 to get 28, and then adding 1 to get 29. So it all checks out!": "**你已经预备了道路:** 跳过计数、学习乘法表和事实系列将为有余数和无余数的除法铺平道路。在开始一般的个位数除法之前，应该掌握和理解所有这些技能。\n\n**无余数:** 除数为整数且无余数的除法题大多由您的孩子通过识别相应的乘法事实来完成。例如，如果要求他们将 36 除以 4，那么记住 4 乘以 9 等于 36 就能直接得到答案。但是，如果该方法对给定问题不起作用，那么他们应该使用下一种方法。\n\n**猜测和跳过计数:** 假设您的孩子被要求用 29 除以 4。您的孩子在涉及 4 的乘法运算中找不到 29，因此他们希望找到一个小于 29 的可行结果。让您的孩子猜一个小于 29 的 4 的倍数。他们可能会猜 24，即 4 乘以 6。然后他们可以跳过计数，直到碰到 29。在这种情况下，这意味着前进到 28，即 4 乘以 7。看到他们必须停在那里，他们得出的答案是 29 除以 4 等于 7，余数为 1。\n\n**检查答案:** 检查答案是让孩子养成的好习惯。在最后一个例子中，我们认为我们发现 29 除以 4 等于 7，余数为 1。通过将 4 乘以 7 得到 28，然后加 1 得到 29 来检查这一点。所以一切都正确！",

  "First and foremost, playing math games should be fun, like any other game your family plays together!\n\nPlease let your child make poor plays (mistakes) without correction, and resist the urge to tell them the best ways to play. Bit by bit, your child will get better at the game, and they will learn so much more if you let them figure things out. There is no hurry.\n\nIf you see your child make a mistake, ask them to describe why they decided to do what they did. If your child is stuck and doesn't know which play to make, ask them to describe the pros and cons of their choices, or ask them about how they solved a similar situation in the past. If your child doesn't remember how to do a calculation, discuss with them the methods they know for figuring it out. These conversations are important for helping your child to develop mathematically. \n\nThrough math game play and math conversations, you are helping your child learn to enjoy math and develop important problem solving skills!": "首先，玩数学游戏是有趣的，就像你与家人一起玩其他游戏一样！\n\n请允许你的孩子没有玩好游戏（在游戏中犯错），不要纠正，也不要急于告诉他们怎么样才是最好的游戏方式。一点一点地，你的孩子会在游戏中变得更擅长，如果你让他们自己把游戏弄清楚，他们将会学到更多。请不要着急。\n\n如果你看到你的孩子犯错，请让他们描述自己为什么选择这样做。如果你的孩子被困住了，并且不知道应该怎么玩，请让他们描述一下他们自己选择的利与弊，或者询问他们过去是怎么解决相似的问题的。如果你的孩子不记得如何计算，和他们讨论如何用他们已知的方法去解决目前的问题。这样的对话对于帮助孩子培养数学思维是很重要的。\n\n通过玩数学游戏和有关数学的对话，你能够帮助你的孩子学会享受数学，并培养对于他们而言很重要的解决问题的能力！",
  "Puzzles are meant to be challenging and to take time, so please don't ruin the fun by telling your child how to do them. These puzzles are chosen so that you can create them easily and then have fun solving them together.\n\nIf your child gets stuck on a puzzle, you have several options. You can, of course, give very small hints, if you can think of things that won't give away the puzzle. You can suggest looking at smaller or simpler versions of the puzzle. Encourage your child to be bold in their ideas, even if sometimes they lead to dead ends. We all learn a lot from our mistakes and dead ends! Let your child know that it is perfectly okay not to solve a puzzle on the first (or second or third) try, and that useful ideas may occur to them if they leave the puzzle alone for a day or two.\n\nThese puzzles are meant to be fun and to teach problem solving. One of the greatest mathematical pleasures is that AHA moment, after many false starts and much wrestling with a problem, when the answer is finally discovered – be sure to let your child experience that feeling of discovery as many times as you can!": "谜题本身就是具有挑战性，且需要花费一定时间的，所以请不要告诉你的孩子怎么做从而破坏了其中的乐趣。选择这些谜题是为了让你可以轻松的创造它们，然后一起解决它们。\n\n如果你的孩子在 一个谜题上卡住了，你有几个选择。当然，你也能在不会泄露解题方法的情况下，给出一些非常小的提示。你可以建议孩子看看更小或更简单的谜题版本。鼓励你的孩子大胆地提出自己的想法，即使有时这些想法会导致死胡同。我们都从错误和死胡同中学到了很多东西！ 让你的孩子知道，在第一次（或第二次，又或者第三次）尝试时，没有解除谜题是完全合理的，如果他们把谜题单独放置一两天，他们可能更容易想到有用的方法。\n\n这些谜题的目的是有趣，并教会如何解决问题。数学最大的乐趣之一是发生在许多错误的开始，和许多与问题的搏斗之后，是当答案最终被发现时顿悟的时刻 — 一定要让你的孩子尽可能多地体验发现的感觉！",
  "Investigations are meant for your child to play with and think about. Let your child explore these looking for interesting patterns and beautiful relationships. Resist the temptation to unveil what is going on and give the answer. If your child seems to have reached a dead end, suggest that they come back to the investigation at a future time to play with it again.\n\nMany investigations benefit from organizing results, and this is a great thing for you to help your child with. Help them make tables, drawings, or whatever may help them see more easily what is going on. And of course, it is perfectly fine to give them gentle nudges from time to time in the right direction. Remember that your child will learn a lot by developing persistence and learning how to look more deeply at things.": "探索是为了让你的孩子能在玩的时候思考。让你的孩子探索这些有趣的规律和美丽的关联。抵制住想要揭开真相并给出答案的欲望。如果你的孩子似乎进入了死胡同，可以建议他们在未来的时间再回来继续玩与探索它。\n\n有条理的探索更有益于学习，这也是你可以参与帮助他们的事情之一。帮助他们制作表格，绘图，或任何可以帮助他们理解正在发生的事情的方法。当然，在正确的方向上时不时地推动他们是完全没问题的。记住，你的孩子会通过培养毅力和学习如何更深入地看待事物，而学到很多东西。",
