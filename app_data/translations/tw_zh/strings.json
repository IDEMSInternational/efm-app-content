  "This activity has your child looking at four things and deciding which three share a property that the fourth one does not. The following is a quick list of examples together with explanations. Children often have a fresh way of looking at things and it is well worth listening to them to see if their reasoning is novel yet sound.\n\nThere are several ways to present these four items to your child. The easiest for you is to simply say the list. If the items are easy to draw, you can draw them. If the items are hard to draw, you may be able to find photos or drawings in ads or magazines that you can cut out and select from. You may be able to use a single photo with lots of content and point out four things in the photo.\n\nFor activities like this, once your child has practiced this for a while and has a solid idea of the activity, it is good to reverse your roles - your child will learn a lot by creating examples for you to solve. As before, their reasoning may be very different from yours, so listen carefully.": "本游戲的規則是讓您的孩子從四個物品中找出與其他三個最不相同的一個。以下是一些示例和對應的説明。孩子們通常會以嶄新的方式看待事物，這值得家長們用心去聆聽並判斷小孩的推理是否既新穎又合理。\n\n將這四個物品告訴孩子的方法有很多種，其中最簡單的方法就是逐個讀出來。如果這些物品容易畫，那麽您可以把它們畫出來。如果這些物品難畫，那麽您可以在廣告或雜誌中找出相應的圖片並剪裁出來。除此之外,您也可以從一張包含大量內容的照片中指出照片中的其中四個物品。\n\n儅您的孩子練習了一段時間后對游戲有了紮實的認識，您就可以與您的孩子進行角色交換。換句話而言就是，由您的孩子出題來讓您解決。這樣他們能從中學到更多東西。一如既往的，他們的推理可能與您的推理大不相同，因此請您仔細觀察 。",

The red triangle is the only one that is not a square. The red square with a hole is the only one that is not solid. The green square is the only one that is not red.\n* dog, cat, lion, goldfish - The lion is the only animal on the list that would make a bad pet.

  "Understanding the Game": "了解遊戲",
  "Without analyzing anything, this game is enjoyable to play and it provides good practice with adding or subtracting 1 and 2. We could leave it at that. However, it is also a great example of two problem solving techniques that you can show to your child when they are ready: 1) learning from simpler examples, and 2) looking for patterns.\n\nAny of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position. Continuing in this way, build up a table of results:\n\n1W - 2W - 3L - 4W - 5W - 6L - 7W - 8W - 9L - 10W": "這款遊戲無需進行任何分析，它本身就很有趣，而且您的孩子可以通過該遊戲來練習1和2的加減法。除此之外，当您的孩子准备好时您可以通过这个例子展示兩個解決問題的好技巧：1）從更簡單的示例中學習， 2）尋找规律。\n\n该游戏的任何版本都可以通過這種方式進行学习。讓我們看一個例子：從10開始做减法，得到0的人获得勝利。這個遊戲的難點是10離0太遠了。所以，讓我們看一個更簡單的版本。當要求孩子這樣做時，他們通常建議從5或6開始（從1開始似乎是荒謬的，但這實際上是他們應該做的！）通常最好是盡可能從簡單的開始（這意味著從1開始）。如果這是您先走並且計數為1，那麽通過減1您就可以獲勝。再試試別的數字。如果計數為2，您可以通過減2獲勝。如果計數為3，那麼您必輸無疑，無論是減去1還是2，您都將對手置於必勝之地。如果計數為4，您將獲勝。因為您將減去1，並將對手置於必敗之地。以此類推，我們可以建立如下表格：\n\n1赢 - 2赢 - 3输 - 4赢 - 5赢 - 6输 - 7赢 - 8赢 - 9输 - 10赢",
  "This table makes it obvious that there is a repeating pattern of 3. When starting at 10, you should want to go first and subtract 1. What is satisfying about this is that, once you decide to look at simpler versions of the problem, the analysis is quick and easy - no tricky analysis needed. Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n\nBut wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1.": "從該表可以看出規律：每三個連續的數字對應的結果都是相同的。所以每當從10開始，您就應該先減去1。讓人感到欣慰的是，無論問題多復雜，一旦您從問題的簡單版本著手，您就可以輕松快捷地尋找到規律而無需進行復雜的分析。現在您已成為尼姆遊戲大師了，從任何數量開始該您都知道該怎麼做！這個基本遊戲的任何版本都同樣容易分析。\n\n那麽現在問題來了：為什麼重復的輸贏規律是數以3計？一旦一個玩家被困在了“輸”的數字（即是3的倍數）上，那麽此後的每一回合兩個玩家所減數字之和都可以是3。因為如果占下風的玩家減去1，則占上風的玩家可以減去2；如果占下風的玩家減去2，那麽占上風的玩家可以減去1。這樣一來占下風的玩家會一直被困在“輸”的數字上。",

This circle drawing was made by moving ahead by one dot on one side of the line segment and ahead by two dots on the other side.": "在一個角的兩側分布著對應兩組相同編號的點，通過連接兩兩相同編號的點就可以製作抽象的集合圖形。您也許在作畫的過程中根本不需要用到這些編號，如果是這樣的話您可以將數字省略掉-這樣就可以讓設計看起來更加整潔。您可以通過讓孩子用彩色繪畫來讓圖案看起來更加豐富多彩。從網絡上您可以在紗線畫的類別中找到很多相關的例子。最右邊這個圓形圖案是通過在線段的一端連接一個點並在另一端連接兩個點來實現的。",

  "This is a special case of the last idea. Put some dots, say 8 or 9, evenly spaced on a circle. Your child can play with creating different patterns by connecting the dots in order, or connecting every second dot, or every third dot. To make it easier to do different experiments, use push pins in a piece of cardboard or wood and then use string between the push pins.\n\nIf your child is intrigued by the patterns that are produced, you can look at questions such as: For a circle with 8 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 3, 5, or 7, but 2 or 4 strings are needed for skipping 2, 4, or 6. Similarly, for a circle with 9 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, but 3 strings are needed for 3 and 6? It’s too young to understand the idea that 2, 4, and 6 have a factor in common with 8, and 3 and 6 have a factor in common in 9 - however, seeing the patterns may plant the seeds for later ideas.": "這是上面提到的最後一個方案的特例。將一定數量的點（比如說8或者9個）均勻地分佈在一個圓上，然後讓您的孩子按數字的順序連接各個點，或者每隔一個或者兩個點來連接。如果想讓這個遊戲進行地更加容易，您可以在一塊紙板或木頭上釘上圖釘來代表各個點，然後用細線在圖釘之間編織圖案。\n\n如果您的孩子對他製作的圖案感興趣，不妨進一步去思考一下這些問題：對於一個有8個點的圓，為什麼通過每跳1、3、5或7步的連接方法只需要用到一條線就可以把所有點連接滿，然而如果是，每跳2、4或者6步則需要用到2條甚至6條線。類似地，對於一個有9個點的圓，為什麼每跳1，2、4、5、7或8步連接只需要用到1條線，而對於3或者6步連接則需要用到3條。雖然對於小孩子來說它們還太小，大概難以理解2、4、6與8有共同的因數，而3、6和9有共同的因數——但是，這個遊戲能給他們日後的思維方式埋下啟蒙的種子。",

  "Puzzle Description": "拼圖說明",
  "The classic version of this puzzle starts with a 4 x 4 empty grid of squares formed by 5 horizontal and vertical lines. Use a set of 15 pieces of paper the size of the grid squares, and number the pieces of paper from 1 to 15. The puzzle starts by having someone place the pieces of paper on the grid. The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty. To achieve this, a piece of paper can be moved if it is adjacent to the empty square - in which case it can be slid into that space. Depending on how the person sets up the puzzle, the puzzle may or may not be solvable.\n\nA 4 x 4 grid is too hard for a beginner, so start with something smaller. The grid could be as small as 2 x 2 or as big as the child wants. The number of numbered pieces of paper will always be one less than the size of the grid. For example, on a 2 x 3 grid use the cards from 1 to 5.": "這個游戏的經典版本以由5條水平和垂直線形成的4 x 4的正方形空網格開始。使用一組15張紙，其大小為網格正方形，並從1到15對紙進行編號。這個游戏的開始是有人將紙放在網格上。游戏的目的是在僅使網格的右下角為空的情況下使紙張有序。為此，如果一張紙與空的正方形相鄰，則可以將其移動-在這種情況下，可以將其滑入該空間。取決於人如何設置拼圖，拼圖可能可以解決，也可能無法解決。\n\n4 x 4的網格對於初學者來說太難了，因此從較小的網格開始。網格可以小到2 x 2，也可以大到孩子想要的大小。編號的紙張數總是比網格的尺寸少一。例如，在2 x 3的網格上，使用從1到5的卡片。",
  "To create these puzzles, you have two options. The first is to place the squares randomly, in which case you have a 50 / 50 chance of the position being solvable. Alternatively, you can start by placing the pieces of paper in the final position and then making a series of legal moves to move the paper around. When you are all done, you are guaranteed that the puzzle is solvable.": "要设计這些拼圖，您有兩個選擇。第一種是將正方形隨機放置，在這種情況下，这个拼图有50%的几率是可解決的。另一种方法是，您可以先將紙張放置在最終完成的位置，然後随机按照游戏规则移动紙張。这样就可以保證拼圖是可解決的。",
  "Solving the Puzzle": "進行遊戲",
  "The main reason for a child to play with this puzzle is to have fun moving pieces around until they accidentally solve it and also to practice getting numbers in order. Despite that simple goal, you may start to wonder about deeper ideas in the puzzle.\n\nA frequent theme of problem solving is to learn from simpler problems or examples. So, let’s do that.\n\nThe smallest example is 2 by 2. For this size, it is clear that the rows will end up being either 1 2; 3 0 or 1 3; 2 0.\n\nThe next smallest is 2 by 3. Start this by getting the 1 and 4 in the left column. Once this is done, your puzzle will look like 1 _ _; 4 _ _ . Finish off the last four squares as you would the 2 by 2 case.\n\nThe 2 by 4 puzzle is done similarly. Start by putting 1 and 5 in the left column. Next, put the 2 and 6 in the second left column without disturbing the 1 and 4. Finally finish off the last 2 by 2.\n\nAt this point, the pattern for attacking puzzles with 2 rows is clear. What to do with more than 2 rows? Suppose you have 3 rows. Start the solution by getting the top row correctly laid out. After that, leave the top row undisturbed and use your ability to solve a puzzle with 2 rows.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 4 rows, do the top row first, the second row next (without disturbing the top row), and finish off the last 2 rows as before.": "讓孩子玩這個遊戲的一個主要原因是讓他們樂在其中，直到他們不小心解決了問題，並且還可以從中練習按順序排列數字。儘管目標很簡單，但您可能會開始好奇這個的更深層的用意。\n\n解決問題的常見方法是從簡單的問題或示例中學習。所以，讓我們開始吧。\n\n最小的示例是2 x2。對於這種大小，很明顯，行最終要麽是1 2; 3 0，或者是1 3; 2 0\n\n第二小的是2x3。對於這個尺寸，可以先把1和4移到最左側一列中。完成此操作後，您的拼圖將看起來像1 _ _； 4 _ _。完成最後的四個正方形，就像處理2 x 2的情況一樣。\n\n2 x 4拼圖的處理方法與此類似。首先把1和5移到最左側一列中。接下來，將2和6放在左側第二列，而先不要管1和4。最後解決2 x2。\n\n目前為止我們已經清楚了如何解決2行拼圖，那麽超過2行的應該怎麼辦？比如說對於3行的拼圖，您可以通過從正確排列第一行著手。之後，維持第一行現狀，接下來的就和解決兩行拼圖一樣了。\n\n同樣，如果有4行，則先進行第一行，然後進行第二行（不影響第一行），然後再像以前一樣完成最後兩行。",
  "Is This Puzzle Solvable?": "這個拼圖可以解決嗎？",
  "Okay, you have a simple method for solving the puzzle. The next question is: How can I just look at the puzzle and know whether it is solvable or not?\n\nTo make describing the answer as simple as possible, do a few quick moves, if needed, to place the empty square in the bottom row. Next, make a list of the rows in one long list - the first row is listed first, the second row is listed second, and so on with the last row listed last. Omit the empty square when you list the last row.\n\nTake this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n\nAs an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n\nWhy does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions.": "很好，您現在已經掌握了一種簡單的方法來解決拼圖。那麽下一個問題來了：我怎樣才能看一下拼圖就知道它是否可以解決呢？\n\n為了使答案的描述盡可能簡單，如有必要，請快速執行一些操作，以將空白正方形放在底行中。接下來，在長列表中列出行的列表——第一行列在第一位，第二行列在第二行，依此類推，最後一行列在最後。當您列出最後一行時，請忽略空的正方形。\n\n拿這個長長的清單，計算其中的反轉次數。當列表中較早的數字大於列表中較晚的數字時，這稱為取反。如果求反數是偶數，那麼這個遊戲就可以解決。如果是奇數，則不是。\n\n以本討論開始時的3 x 3拼圖為例。首先將4移至第二行。然後，列表為：6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7。此列表中有10對數字是順序顛倒的：6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, 和5 3。因為顛倒數字的對數是偶數，所以這個遊戲是可以解決的。\n\n為什麼該規則有效？我不會在這裏進行詳細的推論。關鍵思想是每次移動時都要留意顛倒數字的對數。事實證明，如果您把空格放到最後一行中，那麼在進行任何一步移動之後，顛倒數字的對數始終以偶數變化。因此，如果顛倒數字的對數是奇數，那麽這個拼圖永遠不可能按順序排列。",

I demand that she pays for those smells!\"": "「早上好，」法官用他的深沉聲音說道。「先生，」沙邦古氣憤地說道，「我要求公正！我想對這個女人提出訴訟。過去的三週裡，她每天一大早就趁著我那些怡人香氣最濃郁時走過麵包店，偷走香味。我要求她為那些香味付費！」",

  "How do you think this story is going to end?": "你認為這個故事會如何結束？",
  "\"Only two rands,\" stammered Ma Shange. \"Well,\" said the judge, \"hand it to me, please.\" Meekly, Ma Shange reached into the pocket of her tatty old cardigan and pulled out two one rand coins. She handed them to the judge. He took them, thanking her politely.": "「只有……兩蘭特。」瑪珊戈結結巴巴地答道。「好吧，」法官說「請把它交給我。」瑪珊戈溫順地從破舊羊毛衫的口袋裡掏出兩枚1蘭特硬幣，給法官。法官接過後，禮貌地向她道謝。",

  "Then he shook the coins in his big fist, so that they made a clinking sound. \"This is my judgement,\" he said to the baker. \"The punishment must fit the crime. Therefore the sound of Ma Shange's money is the payment you will get for the smells she stole. And now I wish you a good day.\" The baker looked thoughtful. Then, realizing how unreasonable he had been, he turned slowly and walked out of the room.": "隨後法官搖晃著他的大拳頭，發出叮叮當當的聲響。「這就是我的判決，」他對麵包師說，「懲罰必須與罪行相稱。因此，瑪珊戈的錢的聲音就是對你被她偷走香味的補償。好了，祝你今天快樂。」麵包師若有所思地看了看，之後意識到了自己的無理取鬧，慢慢轉身走出了房間。",

  "What else, if anything, do you think the baker should do for Ma Shange?": "如有可能，你認為麵包師還應該為瑪珊戈做些什麼？",
  "The judge smiled kindly at Ma Shange, and handed her back her money. \"Now, Madam,\" he said pulling a brown paper bag from his briefcase, \"would you care to join me for breakfast? These buns are still warm, I bought them only half an hour ago.\"": "法官對瑪珊戈和藹微笑，並把錢遞還給了她。「現在，夫人，」他邊說邊從公文包裡拿出一個棕色的紙袋，「你願意和我一起吃早餐嗎？這些小圓麵包還很熱乎，我買回來才半個小時。」",

  "**How to play.** A turn consists of placing a tile that matches one of the available ends of the string of dominoes (place double dominoes crosswise to the previous domino). If the player has no matching tile, the player is “blocked,” and there are two possible rules to use: 1) the player’s turn is over, or 2) the player keeps drawing tiles until there is a match (one version restricts this to a single draw whether or not there is a match).

  "**Scoring options:** The winner’s score can be calculated in two ways. The traditional way is to use the sum of the dots on all the other players’ tiles. Rounds are played until a player reaches 50 or 100. For little ones, a better scoring system is to let the winner have the score which is the count of all the other players’ tiles.\n\n**Matching options:** When your child starts adding, change the rule for matching – two tiles match if their numbers add up to six (or nine if using a larger range of dominoes).": "**計分方式:** 勝利者的得分可以透過兩種方式計算。傳統的方法是計算所有其他玩家骨牌上的點數總和，每輪遊戲的得分相加，直到某位玩家達到50或100分。對於年紀較小的玩家，更好的計分方式是勝利者的得分等於其他玩家剩餘骨牌的數量。\n\n**變體：** 當您的孩子開始學習加法時，可以改變匹配規則：兩張骨牌的數字之和為六（如果使用數字範圍更大的多米諾骨牌，則和為九）時，它們匹配。",

There is also a budding understanding of place value and how that relates to expanded form.\n\nCalculational abilities have also grown! Beyond adding and subtracting small numbers, your child has a sense of the number relationships of number bonds and fact families. The ideas of adding and subtracting 1 or 2, adding twins, and near twins, are ready to be the foundation for learning all addition and subtraction facts. Your child has also picked up skip counting by 2, doubling, halving, and even and odd numbers – all of which set the stage for learning multiplication and division.": "**學過了這麼多啊！**\n\n你的孩子做出了這麼大的進步！他會在0到20之間上下計數，並理解這些數字的數值。從0到20之間的任何數字開始，您的孩子都會自如地上下計數。對位值以及它與擴展式的關係也有了初步的理解。\n\n計算能力也有所提高！除了加減小數字，你的孩子還對數字債券和算式家族的數字關係有理解。加減1或2、數字孿生或近數字孿生的想法目前成為了學習所有加減法的基礎。你的孩子還學會了跳躍計數按2、加倍、減半以及瞭解偶數和奇數——這些所有為學習乘法和除法奠定了基礎。",

Matching means that the two numbers on the top domino can be combined with any operation – add, subtract, or even multiply if you want – to make the same result as some, possibly different, operation acting on the two numbers of one of your dominoes.\n\nFor example, if [1, 5] is on top, then it matches [2, 4] because 1 + 5 = 2 + 4, and it also matches [2, 2] because 5 - 1 = 2 x 2. The matching domino is placed on top of the previous top. If you can’t make a match, you must pick up a new domino from the pile.\n\n**How to win:** The first player to get rid of all their dominoes wins.": "**遊戲佈局:** 使用一組從 1 到 6 或從 1 到 9 的多米諾骨牌。每個玩家一開始都有 5 個隨機的多米諾骨牌，且不讓其他玩家看到它們。\n\n**遊戲方法:** 首先，把一張隨機的多米諾骨牌面朝上放置在中間。之後，玩家必須以匹配中間頂部的多米諾骨牌。在這種情況下，匹配意味著頂部多米諾骨牌上的兩個數字可以與任何運算組合，——加法、減法，甚至乘法—— 以產生與作用於其中一個多米諾骨牌上的兩個數字的某些（可能不同）運算相同的結果。\n\n例如，如果 [1,5]這兩數字在頂部，則它與 [2,4] 匹配，因為 1+5 = 2+4，並且它還與 [2,2] 匹配，因為 5-1 = 2x2。以匹配的多米諾骨牌被放置在前一個頂部的頂部。如果你無法進行匹配，你必須從堆中拿起一個新的多米諾骨牌。\n\n**獲勝方法:** 第一個擺脫所有多米諾骨牌的玩家獲勝。",

What other ways are there of discovering that each covered group has 7 items? Your child could count by 2's and see that there are seven 2's as they skip count from 4 to 18. They could break 18 into halves of 9 each and break the 4 into halves of 2 each – then each group of 9 consists of a covered group plus 2 more, so the covered groups are 7 each.\n\nKeep exploring and thinking of ways to use all the interesting math relationships!": "**例子:** 如上圖所示，假設您有 18 件物體，並用兩張紅色紙蓋住其中 14 件。您的孩子看到數字 18，並且有 4 件未覆蓋的物體。他們可以減去18-4，就知道有14物體被覆蓋了。因為使用了相同的顏色，所以覆蓋的物體必須相等，因此每個必須是 7，即 14 的一半。\n\n這是最好的、也是最重要的「步驟」開始的時刻。還有什麼其他方法可以發現每個覆蓋組有 7 個物體？您的孩子可以按 2 數數，並看到有七個 2，因為他們從 4 跳數到 18。他們可以將 18 個分成兩半，每半個 9 個，將 4 個分成兩半，每半個 2 個，然後每組 9 個由一個覆蓋組加上 2 個組成，因此覆蓋組各為 7 個。\n\n繼續探索和思考如何使用所有有趣的數學關係！",

They can compare two double-digit numbers, and they have a beginning sense of place value with 10’s and 1’s.\n\nAs their skip counting is improving, they are also developing skills with multiplying by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The idea of even and odd numbers now makes a lot more sense to them.\n\nExtend activities from earlier stages to these larger numbers: Stage 3: Shape Sums, Going Up Some More; Stage 4: War - Double Digit Add and Subtract, DiffTriangles and SumTriangles, Fix It, Island Hopping by 1’s and 10’s, Fill in the Blanks Comparison, Sum Square, and Addition Pyramid.": "**回顧所學內容**\n\n您的孩子現在可以數到100了！他們可以輕鬆地進行一位數字加減法的心算，還可以從任意數字開始計數或跳數，該技能提高與延伸使他們能夠進行一位數與兩位數的加減。他們可以比較兩個兩位數的大小，也初步認識了十位和個位數的位值。\n\n隨著孩子跳數能力的提高，他們也在開始發展 2、3、4、5 和 10 乘數的技能。奇數和偶數的概念現在對他們來說更加清晰、有意義了。\n\n可以將之前章節的活動延伸到這些更大的數字上：第三章：形狀求和，數字再往上增加；第四章：戰爭-兩位數的加減法、差異三角與總和三角、更改錯誤、從數字1和10開始的跳島、填空比較、求和正方形以及加法金字塔。",
  "New ideas for this stage": "本章的新概念",
  "* Counting to 200 – Introduce the 100’s place by looking at the numbers from 100 to 200.\n* Skip Counting to 100 – This is not new, but it is an important skill to reinforce.\n* Expanded Form and Place Value – This is a foundational skill, so it will be reinforced further.\n* Double-digit Addition and Subtraction – Skip counting will help make this seem effortless.\n* All Single-digit Multiplication – It is time to fill in the missing gaps for 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n* Rectangle Area is Length x Width – This is an important idea in its own right. This fact will also provide many opportunities for fun games and puzzles involving multiplication and factoring.\n* Factoring – Your child will learn the beauty of how numbers break apart into factors. 1 is a unit. A number bigger than 1 only divisible by 1 and itself is prime. A number bigger than 1 that is not prime is composite. 3 **squared** is 3 × 3. 3 **cubed** is 3 × 3 × 3. And 3 raised to a power means to multiply 3 by itself that many times - for example, 3 to the fourth is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.\n* Factors, Divisors, and Multiples – 3 divides evenly into 12. That makes 3 a factor or divisor of 12, and 12 a multiple of 3. 3 is a common factor of 12 and 15, and 12 is a common multiple of 4 and 6.\n* Single-digit Division – Your child will learn division indirectly in the form of finding a missing factor in a multiplication problem.\n* Fact Families for Multiplication and Division – We'll reinforce the connection between these two operations. For example, 2 × 5 = 10, 5 × 2 = 10, 10 / 2 = 5, and 10 / 5 = 2 form a fact family.": "* 數到200 – 看看 100 到 200 的數字，來認識一下百位。\n* 跳數到 100 – 這並不是新知識，但這是一個需要加強的重要技能。\n* 展開式和位值 – 這是一項基礎技能，因此需要進一步加強。\n* 兩位數加減法 – 跳數可以幫我們輕鬆進行兩位數的加減。\n* 一位數乘法 – 是時候學習 6、7、8 和 9 乘法了。\n* 矩形面積＝長×寬 – 這個本身就是一個重要的數學概念。這個知識點還能為很多有趣的遊戲和涉及乘法與因式分解的謎題提供訣竅。\n* 因式分解 – 你的孩子將學習數字如何分解成因數的奇妙之處。1 是一個單位。大於 1 且僅能被 1 和自身整除的自然數是質數；大於 1 且不是質數的數是合數。3 的平方是 3 x 3。3 的立方是 3 x 3 x 3。3 的冪是指將 3 乘以自身很多次——例如，3 的四次方是 3 x 3 x 3 x 3。\n* 因數、約數和倍數 – 3 可以整除 12。這使得 3 成為 12 的因數或約數，而 12 是 3 的倍數。3 是 12 和 15 的公因數，而 12 是 4 和 6 的公倍數。\n* 一位數除法 – 你的孩子將透過在乘法問題中找出缺失的因數來間接學習除法。\n* 乘法和除法的運算族 – 我們將在該階段加強這兩種運算之間的聯繫。例如，2 x 5 = 10、5 x 2 = 10、10 ÷ 2 = 5 和 10 ÷ 5 = 2 構成了一個乘除法運算族（一組相關的數學算式，使用相同的數字，但運算不同）。",

  "**How to solve:** Start with the distinctive entries.\n\nThe 20 forces its row to be multiplying by 4, and then the 36 makes its column be 9.\n\nThe 49 forces its column and row to be multiplying by 7. The 9 forces its column and row to be multiplying by 3.": "**解決方法：** 從獨特的數字開始推理。\n\n20 意味著它所在的行是由 4 乘出來的，而36所在的列是由 9 乘出來的。\n\n49 意味著它所在的列和行是由 7 乘出來的。9 意味著它所在的列和行是由 3 乘出來的。",
  "Continue the detective work in this way and fill in the entries as the headings are discovered.": "繼續以這種方式推理，隨著標題的確定，逐步填空表格。",
  "**Level of difficulty:** Increase or decrease the difficulty by leaving out more or less of the numbers. In this example, the '5' in the 5 column could have been left out – there must be a factor of 5 in 20, and that factor cannot come from 20's row because there is a 36 in that row.\n\n**Your child can make them:** Challenge your child to make one of these puzzles for you. A lot of good thought can go into creating one of these!": "**難度等級：** 透過省略更多或更少的數字來增加或降低難度。 在這個例子中，5 列中的「5」可以省略 - 20 中必須包含 5 的因數，而這個因數不可能來自 20 所在的行，因為該行中有 36。\n\n**讓孩子自己製作：** 讓孩子為你製作這樣一個謎題吧！ 製作謎題需要思考很多。",

For example, if you do 4<sup>2</sup> × 4<sup>3</sup> = (4 × 4) × (4 × 4 × 4) = 4<sup>5</sup>, we have two fours multiplied by three fours, so the result is five fours being multiplied.\n\n**Caution:** Note that this rule for adding exponents only works when it is the same number being taken to a power – you can't easily simplify 3<sup>2</sup> × 5<sup>3</sup>.": "**定義：** 就像 4 × 2 是 </sup></sup></sup>2 + 2 + 2 + 2 的簡寫一樣，2<sup>4</sup> 是 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 的簡寫。 說出「2 的四次方」比重複地說「二乘二再乘二……」更容易理解和表達。 \n\n**特殊名稱：** 二次方，例如 4<sup>2</sup>，可以稱為四的平方，三次方，例如 4<sup>3</sup>，可以稱為四的立方。\n\n**規則：** 相同數的冪相乘時，遵循一個簡單的規則來簡化結果 - 即指數相加。例如，計算 4<sup>2</sup> × 4<sup>3</sup> = (4 × 4) × (4 × 4 × 4) = 4<sup>5</sup>,，我們有兩個四乘以三個四，因此結果是五個四相乘。\n\n**注意：** 請注意，這個指數相加的規則只適用於同一數的冪次方。諸如 3<sup>2</sup> × 5<sup>3</sup> 的乘方運算並不能直接透過這種方式簡化。",

  "MAKING A MOBILE": "製作平衡掛飾",
  "**The setup:** You are given some weights and a design for a mobile that has some attach points. The challenge is to put at most one weight per attach point so the mobile will balance along every arm. Assume the wires are weightless. Each arm in the mobile is a lever that needs balancing, so these puzzles are an extension of the Lever Balance puzzle given earlier in this Stage - practice those puzzles before starting these.": "**準備工作：** 準備一些配重和一個帶有若干個掛鉤的平衡掛飾設計圖。 挑戰是在每個掛鉤上最多放置一個配重，使平衡掛飾沿每個臂保持平衡。假設連接的線沒有重量。 每個平衡掛飾的臂都是需要平衡的槓桿，因此這些謎題是本章之基礎要求供的「槓桿平衡」謎題的延伸——在開始解答這些謎題之前練習那些謎題。",
  "**Simple example:** Start with the simplest mobiles, which are just levers in the air. Above is a solution for putting the weights from 1 to 4 on this mobile to balance it. This works because (2 × 4) + (1 × 2) = (4 × 1) + (3 × 2).\n\n**More complicated example:** Use the total of the weights below it to balance each side of the top wire (1 + 3) × 3 = (4 + 2) × 2.": "**簡單範例：** 從最簡單的平衡掛飾開始，它們就像懸空的槓桿。 以下是如何在這個平衡掛飾上放置 1 到 4 的配重使其平衡。 這是可行的，因為 2 x 4 + 1 x 2 = 4 x 1 + 3 x 2。\n\n**更複雜的範例：** 使用下方配重的總和來平衡頂部金屬絲的兩側 (1 + 3) x 3 = (4 + 2) x 2。",

  "**The setup:** Suppose you have a calculator that is badly broken and you are challenged to produce some result on the calculator. This is easy to play orally whenever you have a spare moment. Here are some examples to get you started.\n\n**Example:** Suppose you had a calculator with +, -, ×, and /, but only one working number key, the 4. Could you get the result 21? If so, what is the fewest number of steps you would need? Suppose you could use 4 at most four times - which numbers could you produce? Suppose you had to use the 4 exactly four times. Play around with having other single keys and creating other results.": "**準備工作：** 假設你有一個壞了的計算器，你面臨著在計算器上算出某個結果的挑戰。 這是一個隨時可以進行的口頭遊戲。 以下是一些入門範例。\n\n**範例：** 假設你的計算器只有加 (+)、減 (-)、乘 (x) 和除 (÷) 功能，但只有一個數字鍵 4 可以使用。你能算出 21 嗎？如果可以，你需要最少的步驟是幾步？假設你最多只能使用數字 4 四次，你能算出哪些數字。假設你必須使用數字 4 恰好四次又會有什麼結果？嘗試使用其他單個數字鍵並算出其他結果。",

  "**The setup:** Have two sets of cards, say from 1 to 25.\n\n**How to play:** Play the standard game of war with these cards, only now the winner is the card that has more factors. For example, 12 beats 16 because 12 has 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12) while 16 has 5 factors (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16). The holder of the winning card must be able to correctly list the factors to win the cards – otherwise, the cards get shuffled back into each player’s draw pile.

The counters start on the end rows of a 100-chart - one player on squares 1 to 10 and the other on squares 91 to 100.\n\n**How to play:** Initially, counters can only move “forward” one row onto any multiple of the number(s) on the marker they choose – for the player starting on 1 to 10, forward means larger numbers, and for the player starting on 91 to 100, forward means smaller numbers. Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can then move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it. A player’s piece cannot double up with another of the same player’s pieces.\n\n**How to win:** You win by taking all your opponent’s pieces.": "**準備工作：** 這個遊戲從跳棋中汲取靈感。每個玩家有 10 個棋子。棋子編號為 1 到 10，其中「10」號棋子標有10和11。棋子最初放置在100以內數字表格的末行上。 一個玩家放在 1 到 10 的正方形上，另一個放在 91 到 100 的正方形上。\n\n**遊戲規則：** 最初，棋子只能根據所選標記上的數字 (或數字) 的任何倍數向前移動一行——對於從1到10開始的玩家，向前意味著更大的數字，對於從91 到 100 開始的玩家，向前意味著更小的數字。一旦棋子穿過整個棋盤，它就變成「王」，然後可以向前或向後移動一行。 通過落在對手的棋子上可以吃掉對方的棋子。玩家的棋子不能與相同玩家的其他棋子重複放置。\n\n**獲勝條件：** 吃掉所有對手的棋子即可獲勝。",

Start talking with your child even though they show no outward signs of understanding you. Make a habit to point at and describe all sorts of things. As your child starts reacting to your words, begin mixing in questions for your child to respond to.\n\nWhen your child begins to understand that objects have properties, start pointing out properties that make things similar or different. These properties are also useful for playing with patterns. Finally, start describing shapes in terms of their many properties.\n\nThe math learning steps for this Stage are:\n\n**1. Math Talk – Early and Often** Constantly pointing at and describing things is very important for a child's development. Start doing this long before they seem to understand.\n**2.

Your child is a sponge who is getting more from your words than you realize.\n\n**Point and describe:** Point at things your child interacts with and describe them with words involving numbers, shapes, and colors. If you are dealing with a small set of things, count them out loud to your child.\n\n**Many facets of Math Talk** There is much more math to talk about than just numbers.\n\n* Describe things. Talk about sizes, colors, textures, shapes, softness, wetness, hotness,\nbrightness, and more. Naming and describing properties is essential for comparing\nthem and discovering patterns.\n* Use comparison words. Bigger, smaller, tallest, widest, more, less, same, ...\n* Use position words. Over, under, between, near, far, above, ...\n* Talk about patterns and sequences in space and time. Refer to the order of things as\nfirst, second, third, and last. Talk about what just happened, what is about to happen,\nand things happening today. Talk about patterns in designs you see.\n* Count things out loud and say numbers to refer to quantities.\n* Use measurement words. Use words for length, area, weight, and volume whenever\nyou are describing sizes.\n\n**This is all math:** These different ways of describing things and their relationships is talking about math! Building up this vocabulary and concepts will help your child develop mathematically. It will also give a big boost to helping your child read and talk about the world.": "**接觸:** 在這些早期年間，一切都與接觸有關！您的孩子正在接觸各種各樣的體驗，並在他們感知的一切中發現模式。作為讓您的孩子接觸世界的一部分，讓他們接觸數學詞匯和思想。讓他們看到一起玩數學是多麼有趣。\n\n**早點開始:** 即使在您的孩子似乎理解您的話之前就開始這樣做。您的孩子就像海綿一樣，從您的話中獲取比您意識到的更多的東西。\n\n**指點和描述:** 指嚮您的孩子接觸到的事物，並用涉及數字、形狀和顔色的詞匯來描述它們。如果您處理的是小數量的事物，請為您的孩子大聲數出來。\n\n**數學對話的多個方麵** 數學對話不僅僅是數字。\n\n* 描述事物。談論大小、顔色、紋理、形狀、柔軟度、濕度、溫度、亮度等等。命名和描述屬性是比較它們和發現模式的基礎。\n* 使用比較詞匯。更大、更小、最高、最寬、更多、更少、相同等 ...\n* 使用位置詞匯。上、下、之間、附近、遠處、上方等 ...\n* 談論空間和時間中的模式和順序。用第一個、第二個、第三個和最後一個來指順序。談論剛發生的事情、即將發生的事情和今天發生的事情。談論您看到的設計中的模式。\n* 大聲數數並說出數字來錶示數量。\n* 使用測量詞匯。描述大小時使用長度、麵積、重量和體積的詞匯。\n\n**這都是數學：** 這些不同方式的描述和討論都是數學。建造詞匯和概念可以在數學方麵幫助你的孩子。這也會很大程度上幫助你的孩子理解並且討論世界上的一切。",
  "1.2 Math Talk – At Home": "步驟2：數學對話——在家裏",
  "As you go about your household routines and activities together, there are many mathematical conversations to have with your child.\n\n**Putting things away:** Talk about which things belong together. Do things that are the same shape go together? Is there a special place for round things or triangular things?\n\n**Clothes:** If you are sorting clothes that are about to be washed or have just been washed, talk about colors, shapes, and sizes. When picking up clothes or putting them away, talk about why some clothes go in one place and others go in other places.\n\n**Going to sleep and getting up:** These times lend themselves to discussing doing things in order, and practicing words like first, second, third, last, and next.\n\n**Discuss as you read:** Storytime is a wonderful chance to do math with your child in a cozy setting. Talk about the characters and the things in the pictures. If there is a big yellow sun, point to the sun and say: “The sun is round and it is yellow. The wall of this room is also yellow. Point to something round in this room.”\n\nAs your child gets older, count together by pointing, such as the yellow flower petals in a picture, or ask your child to point to things you describe.\n\n**Food:** Whether putting food away, cooking food, or setting things out for mealtime, there are many opportunities for math. Different kinds of food should be put away in particular places – this is a good time for relationship words like inside, under, and over.\n\nCooking involves measuring quantities, talking about lengths of time, and describing the desired result for the food. Setting things out for mealtime involves setting out the appropriate number of things so that each person gets what they need.\n\n**Playing with objects:** Compare objects when constructing things for play or other uses. Which one is taller? Can you make one thing taller, wider, bigger, or the same as the other? Describe and compare the sizes, numbers, and colors of things you have or that are in pictures.": "當您和孩子一起進行日常家庭活動時，您會與孩子進行許多有關數學的對話。\n\n**收拾東西:** 討論哪些東西應該放在一起。形狀相同的東西可以放在一起嗎？圓形或三角形的東西有特殊的位置嗎？\n\n**衣服:** 如果你正在整理即將洗或剛洗過的衣服，可以談談顔色、形狀和尺寸。在挑選或收拾衣服時，可以談談為什麼有些衣服放在一個地方，而其他衣服放在其他地方。\n\n**準備去睡覺和起床:** 這些時間適合討論按順序做事，並練習諸如第一、第二、第三、最後和下一個之類的單詞。\n\n**邊讀邊討論:** 講故事時間是與孩子在舒適的環境中做數學題的絕佳機會。談論圖片中的人物和事物。如果有一個黃色的大太陽，指著太陽說：「太陽是圓的，是黃色的。這個房間的牆也是黃色的。指著這個房間裏的圓形物體。」\n\n隨著孩子年齡的增長，可以通過指嚮來一起數數，比如圖片中的黃色花瓣，或者讓孩子指嚮您描述的東西。\n\n**食物:** 無論是收拾食物、烹飪食物還是為用餐時間準備食物，都有很多機會使用數學。不同種類的食物應該放在特定的地方——這是使用關係詞（如裏麵、下麵和上麵）的好時機。\n\n烹飪包括測量數量、討論烹飪時間長度以及描述食物的預期效果。準備就餐時需要準備適當數量的食物，以便每個人都能得到自己需要的食物。\n\n**玩物品:** 在為遊戲或其他用途構建物品時，比較物體。哪一個更高？你能把一個東西做得更高、更寬、更大或與另一個東西一樣嗎？描述並比較你擁有的或圖片中的東西的大小、數量和顔色。",

Traffic signs and shop signs provide a great supply of shapes you can describe and name. There is no end to the shapes, colors, and counting that you can find and talk about once you make a habit of looking for them.\n\n**Traveling:** There are many mathematical things to talk about as you travel. If you see a somewhat unusual red car, you can point that out and count together other red cars that are like it. Ask about bigger, smaller, thinner, and wider things such as buildings, windows, trees, and people. Which things are closer than others, and which things are farther away?\n\n**Counting in a store:** Talk about how many apples you need, and count them out as you pick them out. Count the people in line in front of you, and compare that to the length of the other lines.\n\nPoint out the shapes of fruit or pictures on food boxes. Talk about how some things come in boxes, and other things come in round bottles. You might need something on a high shelf, or something on a low shelf. There is so much to describe and compare!\n\n**In a park:** Count the children, the number of structures or trees, or any- thing else. Comment about where there is more of one thing than an- other.\n\n**On the swings:** Pushing your child on something that swings or sways back and forth is a perfect opportunity to count with your child. With each push, count “1, 2, 3, 4, 5.” After your child starts learning how to count to 5, counting down from 5 is also a good idea. Start or end at 0 sometimes.\n\nPoint out the circles, curves, straight lines, triangles, and rectangles in the park. Talk about how some things are over, under, between, or on top of other things.": "**形狀:** 您可能會看到建築物設計中的一個圓圈，並要求您的孩子指出他們看到的其他圓圈，例如交通信號燈中的圓圈。交通標誌和商店招牌提供了大量可供您描述和命名的形狀。一旦養成尋找它們的習慣，您就可以找到並談論無數的形狀、顔色和計數。\n\n**旅行:** 旅行時，有很多數學話題可以討論。如果你看到一輛有點不尋常的紅色汽車，你可以指出它，並計算出其他類似的紅色汽車的數量。詢問更大、更小、更薄和更寬的事物，例如建築物、窗戶、樹木和人。哪些事物比其他事物更近，哪些事物更遠？\n\n**在商店裏計數:** 談談你需要多少個蘋果，並在挑選時數出它們的數量。數一數你前麵排隊的人，並將其與其他隊伍的長度進行比較。\n\n指出水果的形狀或食物盒上的圖案。談談為什麼有些東西裝在盒子裏，而其他東西裝在圓瓶裏。你可能需要把某樣東西放在高架子上，或者把某樣東西放在低架子上。有太多東西可以描述和比較！\n\n**在公園裏:** 數一數孩子的數量、建​​築物或樹木的數量，或其他任何東西的數量。評論一下哪裏某樣東西比另一樣東西多。\n\n**蕩秋仟:** 將孩子推到可以來回擺動的東西上是與孩子一起數數的絕佳機會。每推一下，就數「1、2、3、4、5」。孩子開始學會數到 5 後，從 5 開始倒數也是一個好主意。有時可以從 0 開始或結束。\n\n指出公園裏的圓形、麯線、直線、三角形和矩形。談談有些東西是如何位於其他東西之上、之下、之間或之上的。",
  "1.4 Math Talk – Describe, Compare": "步驟4：數學討論——描述、比較",
  "**There is important math beyond numbers:** Describing and comparing things is an important part of helping your child learn early mathematics. When children do mathematics, they use ideas about properties of objects to help them work with those objects, such as in grouping them or finding patterns with them. These skills will also help your child when it comes time to start learn- ing to read.\n\n**Point, describe, and compare:** Wherever you are, get in the habit of pointing at things that catch your or your child's attention, and then describing them. Take the opportunity to compare those things to other things to help the descriptions be more meaningful. Talk about how two things are the same or how they are different.\n\n**It is never too early:** From the earliest ages, your child is learning from everything they see, hear, taste, touch, and experience. Add to those experiences with your Math Talk. They are benefiting from your words before they show any reaction to them. Eventually, they will put together the experiences from your words and start showing you that they understand them.\n\n**Expose, but do not rush:** Don't confuse early exposure with teaching. A child will put together the patterns from their experiences as they are developmentally ready. For example, you can't teach your child to count to 5 by explaining it to them – you can only expose them to your counting over and over again until it starts making sense to them. Never be impatient or push them to understand it more quickly – they have a lot to learn and they will naturally want to make sense of it all.\n\n**Searching game:** Make a game of searching for objects around where you are. Use the game to practice concepts that your child is learning, such as color, size (large, medium, small), weight (heavy, light), quantity, and relationship (inside, on top of, below).\n\nOne of you says to the other that they see something that is round on top of something that is brown. The other person tries to discover what it is. If they have trouble finding it, more clues are given.": "**除了數字之外，還有重要的數學:** 描述和比較事物是幫助孩子學習早期數學的重要部分。當孩子們做數學時，他們會利用關於物體屬性的想法來幫助他們處理這些物體，例如對它們進行分組或用它們尋找模式。這些技能也會在孩子開始學習閱讀時有所幫助。\n\n**指出、描述和比較:** 無論身在何處，都要養成指嚮引起您或您孩子註意的事物，然後描述它們的習慣。利用機會將這些事物與其他事物進行比較，使描述更有意義。談論兩件事如何相同或不同。\n\n**永遠不會太早:** 從很小的時候起，您的孩子就開始從他們所看到、聽到、嘗到、觸摸到和體驗到的一切中學習。通過數學談話來豐富這些經驗。在他們做出任何反應之前，他們就已經從您的話語中受益匪淺。最終，他們會從您的話語中總結經驗，並開始嚮您錶明他們理解這些經驗。\n\n**揭露，但不要著急:** 不要將早期接觸與教學混為一談。孩子在發育成熟後會將他們的經曆中的模式整合在一起。例如，您不能通過嚮孩子解釋來教他們數到 5——您隻能一遍又一遍地嚮他們展示您的計數方式，直到他們開始理解為止。永遠不要不耐煩或強迫他們更快地理解——他們有很多東西要學，他們自然會想要理解這一切。\n\n**搜尋遊戲:** 玩一個尋找周圍物體的遊戲。利用這個遊戲來練習孩子正在學習的概念，例如顔色、大小（大、中、小）、重量（重、輕）、數量和關係（內部、頂部、下方)。\n\n你們其中一人告訴另一人，他們看到一個圓形的東西放在棕色的東西上麵。另一人試著找出那是什麼。如果他們找不到，就會給出更多線索。",
  "1.5 Math Talk – Counting": "步驟5：數學討論——計數",
  "**Counting, Numbers, and Quantities:** Counting and numbers are what comes to mind when most people think of early math, and they are the easiest to relate to and understand. Counting is also easy to verbalize in front of your child. There are several things to work on at the same time, so it can be more complicated for your child than what you might think.\n\n* Counting forward and backward, including 0 sometimes \n* Learning the numbers\n* Learning quantities\n\n**Repeating the sequence:** At first, all your counting in front of your child will lead to your child starting to repeat the numbers in sequence. Don't be surprised if they leave out some of the numbers or they say the numbers in the wrong order. If they make these errors, don't make a big deal out of it; simply say the count correctly and move on. This is all part of the process and they will eventually learn the numbers in the correct order.\n\n**Count down sometimes:** Counting down will help your child understand the sequence. This helps keep it from being a meaningless sequence of sounds they make that makes adults happy. You can do this almost any time you would have counted up. For example, if you have three apples you want to remove, count down from three after you take away each apple.\n\n**Include 0 sometimes:** Start your counting at 0 sometimes to help 0 become an accepted number and quantity. You can also count down to 0. Counting down to 0 is great for events that are about to happen, say in ten seconds. You can count down to 0 and then say \"Blastoff\" or something similar.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive to an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things about counting and quantities. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when they count something they do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers they're saying. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally, they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Count everything:** There are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it out loud in front of your child, and be sure to count down sometimes and to include 0 sometimes.": "**計數、數字和數量:** 大多數人想到早期數學時首先想到的是計數和數字，它們是最容易聯係和理解的。計數也很容易在孩子麵前用語言錶達。由於需要同時進行多項練習，因此對孩子來說，這可能比您想象的要複雜得多。\n\n* 正嚮和反嚮計數，有時包括 0\n* 學習數字\n* 學習數量\n\n**重複這一過程:** 一開始，你在孩子麵前數數會讓孩子開始按順序重複數字。如果他們漏掉了一些數字，或者說出了錯誤的順序，請不要感到驚訝。如果他們犯了這些錯誤，不要太在意；隻要正確地說出數字，然後繼續。這都是過程的一部分，他們最終會以正確的順序學習數字。\n\n**有時倒數:** 倒數可以幫助孩子理解順序。這有助於避免他們發出毫無意義的聲音序列，而這些聲音會讓成年人感到高興。幾乎任何時候你都可以這樣做。例如，如果你有三個蘋果要拿走，那麼在你拿走每個蘋果後，從三開始倒數。\n\n**有時包括 0:** 有時從 0 開始計數，有助於讓 0 成為公認的數字和數量。您也可以倒數到 0。倒數到 0 非常適合即將發生的事件，例如十秒後。您可以倒數到 0，然後說「Blastoff」或類似的話 。\n\n**理解數量:** 對於成年人來說，如果你數一堆東西，比如說四塊鵝卵石，當你數「1、2、3、4」時，你說出的最後一個數字就是你擁有的東西的數量大小，這是完全直觀的。你的孩子正在學習一些關於計數和數量的知識。他們正在對數量産生理解。他們正在學習當他們數東西時，他們會將東西和他們所說的數字一一對應。他們正在學習計數的順序並不重要。最後，他們正在學習「最後一個數字是大小」的規則。成年人認為這些事情是理所當然的，但對於孩子來說，學習這些事情是很重要的。要有耐心，記住不要著急。\n\n**计算一切:** 有太多东西需要数数。数椅子、走一小段距离需要走多少步、食物、排队的人、一群人、桌子周围或房间里的家具、手臂、腿，还有谁知道还有什么。每当你发现自己在心里数着某样东西时，就在孩子面前大声数数，一定要有时倒数，有时包括 0。",
  "1.6 Math Talk – Point, Describe, Ask": "步驟6：數學對話——指出、描述和提问",
  "**Responding:** Once your child is able to respond to what you say, that will allow you to start asking questions. Your \"Point and Describe\" Math Talk will now become Point, Describe, and Ask. Even before your child can say words, they will start to respond nonverbally to you as they begin to make sense of your words.\n\n**Ask questions:** Use this new level of communication to make it clearer which ideas your child understands. \"Where is the bird?\" or \"Where is the ball? makes it clear if your child knows what a bird or ball is. Similarly, \"Point to the tree.\" or \"Point to a car.\" works for those two concepts.\n\n**Handling mistakes:** Ask all kinds of questions. Ask which of two things is bigger or smaller. Ask where you are walking to. Ask where something belongs. All these questions are opportunities for your child to express their understanding and for you to clear up any misconceptions. If your child points to the wrong thing or picks up the wrong thing, simply point out the right thing and don't try to explain their mistake to them.\n\n**Do this while reading:** Now you can add asking questions to your pointing and describing as you read a story. Point to pictures in the story and ask the same questions you would ask about the things around you.\n\n**Simple riddles:** Play games with your child's new skill and have fun with it. Have fun unraveling puzzles together such as: \"There is something red under something blue. Where is it?\"": "**回應:** 一旦您的孩子能夠回應您的話語，您就可以開始提問。您的「指出並描述」數學談話現在將變成指出、描述和詢問。甚至在您的孩子能夠說話之前，他們就會開始用非語言方式回應您，因為他們開始理解您的話語。\n\n**問問題:** 使用這種新的溝通方式，讓您的孩子更清楚地了解哪些概念。「鳥在哪裏？」或「球在哪裏？」可以清楚地錶明您的孩子是否知道什麼是鳥或什麼是球。同樣，「指嚮樹。」或「指嚮汽車。」適用於這兩個概念。\n\n**處理錯誤:** 問各種各樣的問題。問兩件東西中哪件更大或更小。問你要去哪裏。問某物屬於哪裏。所有這些問題都是讓您的孩子錶達他們的理解並讓您澄清任何誤解的機會。如果您的孩子指嚮錯誤的東西或拿起錯誤的東西，隻需指出正確的東西，不要試圖嚮他們解釋他們的錯誤。\n\n**閱讀時這樣做:** 現在，你可以在閱讀故事時，在指點和描述中添加提問。指著故事中的圖片，問一些與你對周圍事物提出的問題相同的問題。\n\n**簡單的謎語:** 和孩子一起玩新技能的遊戲，享受其中的樂趣。一起解開謎題，享受其中的樂趣，例如：「藍色物體下麵有紅色物體。它在哪裏？」",
  "1.7 Object Properties": "步驟7：對象屬性",
  "**Your child responds!:** All the pointing, describing, and asking you have been doing with your child has established that things have properties that can be discussed and reasoned with. You have been building up a vocabulary of words and concepts for describing things. It is time to start making more use of them.\n\n**Ask for things with a specific property:** Practice using properties by asking your child to bring you something with that property. You could ask \"Please bring me something that is red.\" for example. As your child gets better at this, make the requests more complicated by combining more than one property – \"Find a round wooden thing.\"\n\n**Grouping things with a property:** Practice grouping things with the same property. If your child has a collection of objects, ask to have all the round things put to one side.": "**你孩子的回答！:** 你對孩子所做的所有指點、描述和詢問都已經確立了事物具有可以討論和推理的屬性。你一直在建立用於描述事物的詞匯和概念。現在是時候開始更多地使用它們了。\n\n**尋找具有特定屬性的物品：** 通過要求您的孩子給您帶來具有該屬性的物品來練習使用屬性。例如，您可以問“「請給我帶來一些紅色的東西。」隨著您的孩子在這方麵的進步，通過結合多個屬性使請求變得更加複雜——「找到一個圓形的木製物體。」\n\n**根據屬性對事物進行分組:** 練習將具有相同屬性的物品分組。如果您的孩子有一組物品，請要求將所有圓形物品放在一邊。",
  "**A circle for each property:** Make this more visible by drawing a big circle and having all the things that have a particular property put in that circle. For example, you could have all the things with a hole in them put in the circle. As this becomes easy for your child, use two circles that overlap – one circle could be for triangles, the other for things with holes, and the common area to the two circles would be for triangles with holes.": "**每個屬性一個圓圈:** 畫一個大圓圈，將所有具有特定屬性的事物放入圓圈中，使這一點更加明顯。例如，你可以將所有有洞的事物放入圓圈中。當您的孩子覺得這很容易做到時，使用兩個重疊的圓圈——一個圓圈可以錶示三角形，另一個圓圈錶示有洞的事物，兩個圓圈的公共區域可以錶示有洞的三角形。",
  "**Which one doesn't belong?:** A fun activity for practicing with proper- ties is to show your child a small set of objects and ask which of them doesn't belong. Challenge your child to identify the object that is not like the others and to explain why. Accept any reason that makes sense; your child may have an unusual reason.\n\nFor example, you could have pictures of some animals. Perhaps only one of them can fly. Maybe only one of them has two legs. This ac- tivity can provide fun challenges that let your child do some creative thinking with new concepts.": "**哪一個不屬於?:** 練習屬性的一個有趣活動是嚮孩子展示一小組物體，並詢問其中哪些不屬於。挑戰孩子找出與其他物體不同的物體並解釋原因。接受任何合理的理由；您的孩子可能有一個不尋常的理由。\n\n例如，你可以放一些動物的圖片。也許隻有其中一種動物會飛。也許隻有其中一種動物有兩條腿。這項活動可以提供有趣的挑戰，讓您的孩子用新概念進行創造性思考。",
  "1.8 Same and Different": "步驟8：相同與不同",
  "**Comparing:** Help your child understand properties better by comparing and contrasting them.\n\n**Examples:** For example, talk about the size or age of a child and an adult – one is younger and the other older, and one is shorter and the other is taller. Or you could talk about a bird and a dog – one can fly and has feathers and the other has fur and cannot fly.\n\n**Same and different:** Make a playful activity out of this by showing your child two objects and asking how they are the same and how they are different. Be prepared for surprising ideas and do include silly suggestions along with the more serious ones.\n\n**More examples:** If you hand your child a spoon and fork, there are many things your child might say. They are the same because you eat with both of them. They are also the same because you hold both of them, they are about the same size, or they are made of the same material. They are different because one is smooth and somewhat round, while the other is pointed.": "**比較:** 通過比較和對比幫助您的孩子更好地理解屬性。\n\n**例子:** 例如，談論一個孩子和一個成年人的體型或年齡——一個比較小，另一個比較大，一個比較矮，另一個比較高。或者你可以談論一隻鳥和一隻狗——一隻可以飛，有羽毛，另一隻有毛，不能飛。\n\n**相同與不同:** 讓這項活動變得有趣，嚮孩子展示兩件物品，並詢問它們有何相同之處和不同之處。準備好接受令人驚訝的想法，並在提出更嚴肅的建議的同時加入一些愚蠢的建議。\n\n**更多示例:** 如果你遞給孩子一把勺子和一把叉子，孩子可能會說很多話。它們是相同的，因為你用它們吃飯。它們也是一樣的，因為你拿著它們，它們大小差不多，或者它們是由相同的材料製成的。它們是不同的，因為一個是光滑的，有點圓，而另一個是尖的。",
  "1.9 Patterns": "步驟9: 圖案",
  "Patterns are everywhere! Recognizing, describing, and creating patterns is central to playing with mathematics.": "圖案無處不在！識別、描述和創建圖案是玩數學的關鍵。",
  "Here are some characteristics that can be used by themselves or mixed together to create patterns:\n\n* Movement patterns: stepping, jumping, waving, nodding\n* Sound patterns: clapping, knee slapping, tongue clicking, stamping \n* Loudness patterns: soft, medium, loud\n* Visual patterns: color, shape, size\n\n**Discover patterns:** Challenge each other to find repeating patterns wherever you are. You might notice a repeating tile work in a floor, wall, or ceiling. The brick work of a building might make an interesting pattern. Plants may be planted in an organized pattern in a field. The side of a pineap- ple or pine cone may have a spiral pattern. Something may be producing sounds in a repeating pattern.\n\n**Game: Repeat patterns:** Two or more of you can challenge each other to repeat and extend each other's patterns. This can be done in many ways. The simplest is for one person to create a pattern of sounds and movements and have all the others repeat it.\n\nAdd difficulty to this by having the original person add one more item to the end of the pattern every time the pattern goes once around the group. Alternatively, each person can take the pattern that comes to them and one more item at the end of it.\n\n**Secret handshakes or knocks:** Use patterns as an agreed upon way for being allowed to enter some place such as a room. This might be a series of fist bumps and other type of handshakes. Or it might be knocking and stamping that causes a series of sounds.\n\n**Sequence of drawings:** For older children, create puzzles by drawing a pattern of shapes. One person establishes a pattern and then leaves gaps in the repeating sequence for the other to fill in.": "以下是一些可以單獨使用或混合使用以創建模式的特徵:\n\n* 運動方式：邁步、跳躍、揮手、點頭\n* 声音模式：拍手、拍膝蓋、咂舌、跺腳\n* 响度模式：輕、中、響\n* 视觉图案：顔色、形狀、大小\n\n**探索圖案:** 挑戰彼此，無論身在何處，都要找到重複的圖案。您可能會註意到地闆、牆壁或天花闆上有重複的瓷磚圖案。建築物的磚砌結構可能會形成有趣的圖案。植物可能以有組織的圖案種植在田野中。鳳梨或鬆果的側麵可能有螺旋圖案。某些東西可能會以重複的模式發出聲音。\n\n**遊戲：重複圖案:** 你們兩個或兩個以上的人可以互相挑戰，重複和擴展彼此的模式。這可以通過多種方式實現。最簡單的方法是讓一個人創建一個聲音和動作的模式，然後讓所有其他人重複它。\n\n讓最初的人每次圖案在小組中轉一圈時在圖案的末尾添加一個物品，從而增加難度。或者，每個人都可以拿起來到他們身邊的圖案，並在圖案的末尾添加一個物品。\n\n**秘密握手或敲門:** 使用模式作為獲準進入某個地方（例如房間）的約定方式。這可能是一係列的拳頭碰擊和其他類型的握手。或者可能是敲門和跺腳，從而發出一係列聲音。\n\n**繪圖順序:** 對於年齡較大的孩子，可以通過繪製形狀圖案來製作拚圖。一個人建立一個圖案，然後在重複的序列中留下空白，讓另一個人填補。",
  "1.10 Basic Shapes I": "步驟10：基本形狀 I",
  "**The world of shapes:** There are many possibilities that open up as your child's understanding of properties grows. For example, they can now understand geometric shapes and talk about them!\n\n**Counting sides:** Distinguishing between a triangle, square, rectangle, hexagon, and octagon will involve the idea of \"sides\" and being able to count those sides. Your child's growing understanding of quantities will make this counting possible. Also, as your child begins to automatically identify these shapes, that will help them to deepen their understand of the quantities for 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n**Basic shapes:** For now, stay with basic shapes and build confidence and fluency with those shapes. Of course, you can always mix in any additional shapes, such as stars, that your child happens to enjoy.\n\nHere is a list of words for flat shapes:\n\n* Circle\n* Triangle\n* Rectangle (looks like a piece of paper) \n* Square (rectangle with equal sides)\n* Hexagon (6 sides)\n* Octagon (8 sides – stop sign)\n\nThis is a list of words for 3-dimensional shapes:\n\n* Ball (Sphere)\n* Cylinder (Round tube) \n* Box (Cube)\n\n**Hands on:** Use and explain these shape names as your child plays with objects that have these shapes.

  "2.1 Counting Up From 1 and 0": "步驟11：從 1 和 0 開始計數",
  "**Count everything:** Your child can already count to 5. You are now helping them to solidify that counting and as well as extend it to larger numbers. Count things in front of your child and also count with your child when your child wants to. Counting is the foundation of understanding quantities. It also builds a basis for addition and subtraction.\n\nThere are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it with your child, and be sure to include 0 as a starting point sometimes.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive for an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4,\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when you count something you do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Mistakes:** There are many kinds of mistakes you should expect your child to make as they count. Your child may leave out numbers or they may leave out some of the numbers. Or they may get mixed up in doing 1-1 correspondence with a group of things they are counting. Your child will sort all this out with time. For now, when your child makes a mistake, simply count the things out in front of them correctly and move on to something else.\n\n**Understand the numbers:** Don't be in such a hurry for your child to repeat the numbers 1 to 10 that they have no idea what they are saying. Take time with it and reinforce the connection of each number with its corresponding quantity.\n\n**Reading numbers:** You may of course start introducing reading the numbers whenever you like. However, don't let the reading limit the counting. Learning to read numerals will typically take longer than learning to say the numbers and getting a sense of the quantities.": "**數一切:** 您的孩子已經可以數到 5 了。您現在正在幫助他們鞏固數數能力，並將其擴展到更大的數字。在孩子麵前數數，並在孩子願意的時候和他一起數數。數數是理解數量的基礎。它還為加法和減法奠定了基礎。\n\n需要數的東西太多了。數椅子、走一小段距離需要走多少步、食物、排隊的人、一群人、桌子周圍或房間裏的家具、手臂、腿，還有誰知道還有什麼。每當你發現自己在心裏數著某樣東西時，就和你的孩子一起數，有時一定要把 0 作為起點。\n\n**理解數量:** 對於成年人來說，如果你數一堆東西，比如說四塊鵝卵石，當你數「1、2、3、4」時，你說的最後一個數字就是你擁有的東西的數量。你的孩子正在學習幾件事。他們正在對數量産生理解。他們正在學習當你數某樣東西時，你會在東西和數字之間建立一一對應的關係。他們正在學習計數的順序並不重要。最後，他們正在學習「最後一個數字是大小」的規則。成年人認為這些事情是理所當然的，但對於孩子來說，學習這些事情是很重要的。要有耐心，記住不要著急。\n\n**錯誤:** 您應該預料到孩子在數數時會犯許多錯誤。孩子可能會漏掉一些數字，或者漏掉一些數字。或者，他們可能會搞混他們正在數的一組東西的 1-1 對應關係。隨著時間的推移，您的孩子會理清所有這些問題。現在，當您的孩子犯錯時，隻需正確地數出他們麵前的東西，然後繼續做其他事情。\n\n**理解數字:** 不要急著讓孩子重複 1 到 10 的數字，否則他們根本不知道這些數字在說什麼。花點時間，強化每個數字與其對應數量的聯係。\n\n**讀取數字:** 當然，您可以隨時開始學習閱讀數字。但是，不要讓閱讀限製計數。學習閱讀數字通常比學習說數字和了解數量需要更長的時間。",
  "2.2 Counting Down to 1 and 0": "步驟12：倒數至 1 和 0",
  "**It helps with meaning:** Counting down is surprisingly effective at solidifying understanding of the number sequence. Many very young children who have learned to count from 1 to 10 have a difficult time when they first try to count from 10 down to 1. This counting in the opposite order forces them to think in a fresh way about how the numbers are ordered. This will be particularly true when your child starts counting to 100 and they start thinking about what happens as they go from one decade to the next – say between 69 and 70.\n\n**It helps with subtraction:** Counting down is also very helpful with learning to subtract. A child who can count down will very quickly learn how to subtract 1 and 2. It is also helpful if counting down becomes automatic, so they can use their full attention on counting down the three steps when doing 9 subtract 3, for example.\n\n**Use when natural:** There are many times when counting down is the natural thing to do. If there are ten seconds left on a timer, you can count down together with the counter. If you say that something can be done three more times, then you can count down from three together.\n\n**Include 0:** It is usually natural to include 0 when counting down, and this is a good thing to do. If you are counting down the time remaining, when you reach 0 you have 0 seconds left. If you count down how many pieces of food your child can eat, when you reach 0 there will be no food left. It is helpful to make 0 a normal and expected quantity to work with.": "**它有助於理解意義:** 倒數對於鞏固對數字序列的理解非常有效。許多已經學會從 1 數到 10 的幼兒在第一次嘗試從 10 數到 1 時會遇到睏難。這種反嚮計數迫使他們以新的方式思考數字的排序方式。當你的孩子開始數到 100 時，他們會開始思考從一個十年到下一個十年會發生什麼——比如從 69 到 70。\n\n**它有助於減法:** 倒數對於學習減法也很有幫助。會倒數的孩子很快就能學會減 1 和 2。如果倒數能成為一種習慣，那麼他們就可以全神貫註地倒數三個步驟，例如，在做 9 減 3 時。\n\n**自然情況下使用:** 很多時候，倒計時是很自然的事情。如果計時器還剩 10 秒，你可以和計數器一起倒計時。如果你說某件事還可以做三次，那麼你可以和計數器一起從三開始倒計時。\n\n**包括 0:** 倒計時時通常自然會包含 0，這是件好事。如果您倒計時剩餘時間，當計數到 0 時，您就剩下 0 秒了。如果您倒計時孩子可以吃多少塊食物，當計數到 0 時，就冇有食物了。將 0 設為正常的預期數量會很有幫助。",
  "2.3 Comparing Small Quantities": "步驟13：比較小數量",
  "**It takes time:** All these beginning concepts and skills take lots of time for your child to master, and comparing quantities and getting a sense of the size of quantities is no different. Create many, many experiences that allow your child to touch, feel, and directly experience the sizes of quanti- ties and how they compare.\n\n**Line them up:** One simple way to compare the sizes of two quantities is to line them up in 1-to-1 correspondence next to each other. For example, if you play a card game and you want to see who won, you can line up the cards of the two players and see which line has extra cards.\n\n**Common misunderstanding:** Be aware that a small child may think that two short sticks is the same amount as one long stick. This is perfectly understandable, but it is often not what the adult had in mind.\n\n**Give choices:** Put your child in situations where they can choose between two groups of of the same things they really like. When they pick the bigger group, reinforce it by saying that the chosen group had more than the other group.\n\n**Games:** You may be able to start playing simple card games, such as the game of \"War.\" Use the dots on the cards to allow your child to compare the quantities. Another good game to practice with is \"I'm Thinking of a Number,\" where you have a number line of cards with something hidden under one of the cards.\n\n**Number lines:** Number lines are an excellent visual aid for seeing which numbers are smaller (the ones on the left) and which are larger (the ones on the right). This is a good thing to expose your child to from an early age, but be aware that both the numerals and their being in a line is fairly abstract, so it will be a while before they understand what is going on with this picture that has numbers.": "**這需要時間:** 所有這些初級概念和技能都需要孩子花費大量時間才能掌握，而比較數量和了解數量大小也同樣如此。創造許多體驗，讓您的孩子觸摸、感受和直接體驗數量的大小及其比較方式。\n\n**把它們排成一行:** 比較兩個量的大小的一個簡單方法是將它們一一對應地排成一排。例如，如果你玩紙牌遊戲，想知道誰贏了，你可以把兩個玩家的牌排成一排，看看哪一行有多餘的牌。\n\n**常見誤解:** 請註意，小孩子可能會認為兩根短棍和一根長棍一樣多。這是完全可以理解的，但這通常不是成年人的想法。\n\n**給選擇:** 讓您的孩子在兩組他們真正喜歡的相同物品之間做出選擇。當他們選擇較大的組時，告訴他們所選的組比另一組有更多物品，以此來強化他們的選擇。\n\n**遊戲:** 你可以開始玩一些簡單的紙牌遊戲，比如「戰爭」遊戲。利用紙牌上的點數讓孩子比較數量。另一個適合練習的遊戲是「我在想一個數字」，在這個遊戲中，你有一排數字牌，其中一張牌下藏著一些東西。\n\n**數軸:** 數軸是一種很好的視覺輔助工具，可以幫助你看出哪些數字較小（左邊的數字），哪些數字較大（右邊的數字）。從小就讓孩子接觸數軸是一件好事，但要註意，數字和它們在一條線上是相當抽象的，所以他們需要一段時間才能理解這張有數字的圖片是怎麼回事。",
  "2.4 Counting On": "步驟14：繼續",
  "**Surprisingly powerful:** The technique called Counting On is a simple idea that is surprisingly helpful. As your child gets comfortable with seeing a group of objects as a quantity, start doing Counting On in front of them to help them get the idea of it.\n\n**Example:** Suppose your child has one row of 3 cards and another row of 4 cards. They can count all the cards one at a time \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\" and see that there are 7 cards. However, if your child recognizes that there are three cards in one row, they don't need to count those cards. They can start their counting at 3, pointing to the three cards on the first row, and then count the second row \"4, 5, 6, 7.\" Your child is Counting On starting at 3, and that's where the name comes from.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** Being able to Count On saves time and effort. It also signals that your child is getting comfortable seeing the quantity associated with a group of objects and can work with them as a group. This is a big conceptual leap that will be very useful to them in all the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing soon to come.\n\n**Connection with addition:** Beginning addition is strongly linked to counting. When given a card with three dots on it, and another card with four dots on it, a child asked to add these two quan- tities will count them from 1 to 7. It is faster and more powerful to do this adding of 3 and 4 by starting at 3, or 4, and counting on using the other number. You will see finger techniques for doing this in upcoming lessons.": "**出人意料的強大:** 計數技巧很簡單，但非常有用。當您的孩子習慣將一組物體視為一個數量時，開始在他們麵前進行計數，以幫助他們理解這個概念。\n\n**例子:** 假設您的孩子有一排 3 張卡片，另一排 4 張卡片。他們可以一次數出所有卡片「1、2、3、4、5、6、7」，並看到有 7 張卡片。但是，如果您的孩子認識到一行中有三張卡片，他們就不需要數那些卡片了。他們可以從 3 開始數數，指嚮第一排的三張卡片，然後數第二排「4、5、6、7」。您的孩子從 3 開始數數，這就是這個名字的由來。\n\n**理解數量:** 能夠“數數”可以節省時間和精力。這也錶明您的孩子已經習慣了觀察與一組物體相關的數量，並可以將它們作為一個整體來處理。這是一個巨大的概念飛躍，對他們即將進行的所有加、減、乘、除運算非常有用。\n\n**與加法的聯係:** 開始學習加法與數數密切相關。當給孩子一張上麵有三個點的卡片和另一張上麵有四個點的卡片時，要求他們把這兩個數字相加的孩子會從 1 數到 7。從 3 或 4 開始，用另一個數字數數，這樣可以更快、更有效地完成 3 和 4 的加法。您將在接下來的課程中看到如何用手指做這件事。",
  "2.5 Basic Shapes II": "步驟15：基本形狀 II",
  "**Deepening explorations:** Bit by bit, your child's developing skills with shapes, counting, and de- scriptions will allow you to include more detailed and advanced aspects of shapes. Use lots of hands-on experiences for your child. Have your child fit pieces together, pile things on top of each other, put things inside other things, and study how shapes are put together in all the objects around them. As your child experiences these things, name and discuss the shapes, and ask lots of questions about them.\n\n**Shape words:** It may seem like there are a lot of words to learn. However, if you make a habit of exposing your child to these words, your child will pick them up slowly but surely.\n\nThis is a list of flat shapes:\n\n* Parallel lines (railroad tracks, two lines in the same direction that don't meet) \n* Right angle (angle found in the corner of a piece of paper)\n* Circle\n* Triangle\n* Rectangle (looks like a piece of paper, it has four right angles) \n* Square (rectangle with equal sides)\n* Parallelogram (opposite sides are parallel)\n* Rhombus (has four equal sides)\n* Trapezoid (one pair of parallel sides) \n* Pentagon (five sides)\n* Hexagon (6 sides)\n* Octagon (8 sides, stop sign)\n\nThis is a list of 3-dimensional shapes:\n\n* Sphere (Ball)\n* Cylinder (Round tube)\n* Box (Cube)\n* Pyramid (with a triangle or square as base)\n\n**Symmetries:** A lot of shapes have one side that looks like the other side upon being reflected. This is called mirror symmetry. The outside shape of a human body has mirror symmetry.\n\n**Tilings:** Point out tiling patterns to your child. A lot of buildings have tiling patterns on floors, walls, or ceilings. Brick walls often have interesting patterns made by their bricks. These patterns often have mirror symmetries.": "**深化探索:** 隨著孩子對形狀、計數和描述的技能逐漸發展，您將能夠更詳細、更高級地了解形狀。讓孩子多做親身體驗。讓孩子將零件拚合在一起，將東西堆疊在一起，將東西放在其他東西裏麵，並研究周圍所有物體的形狀是如何組合在一起的。當您的孩子體驗這些事情時，說出形狀的名稱並進行討論，並提出大量有關它們的問題。\n\n**形詞:** 看起來似乎有很多單詞需要學習。但是，如果你養成讓孩子接觸這些單詞的習慣，孩子就會慢慢但穩步地學會它們。\n\n這是平麵形狀的列錶：\n\n* 平行線（鐵軌，同方嚮但不相交的兩條線）\n* 直角（紙張角落處的角）\n* 圓圈\n* 三角形\n* 矩形（看起來像一張紙，有四個直角）\n* 正方形（邊相等的長方形）\n* 平行四邊形（對邊平行）\n* 菱形（四條邊相等）\n* 梯形（一對邊平行）\n* 五角大樓（五條邊）\n* 六邊形（6 條邊）\n* 八邊形（8 條邊，有停車標誌）\n\n這是三維形狀的列錶:\n\n* 球體(球)\n* 氣缸（圓管）\n* 盒子（立方體）\n* 金字塔（以三角形或正方形為底麵）\n\n**對稱性:** 許多形狀在反射時，一側看起來與另一側相似。這稱為鏡像對稱。人體的外形具有鏡像對稱性。\n\n**平鋪:** 嚮孩子指出瓷磚圖案。許多建築物的地闆、牆壁或天花闆上都有瓷磚圖案。磚牆通常有磚塊製成的有趣圖案。這些圖案通常具有鏡像對稱性。",
  "2.6 One More and One Less": "步驟16：多一個，少一個",
  "**More important than they look:** It is tempting to think of these ideas as minor, almost trivial steps. However, the ideas of One More and One Less are early and important steps for adding and subtracting.\n\n**Counting up and down:** One more and one less are strongly connected to the ideas of the next number and previous number when you are counting up and down. Counting practice with count- ing both directions will help make it easy for your child to know which number comes next and which number was the previous one.\n\n**Adding 1 and taking away 1:** Combine these ideas with adding and subtracting by asking ques- tions such as: \"How many pebbles do you have now? If I added 1 more, how many would you have? If I took 1 away so you had 1 less, how many would you have?\" These are very easy and natural questions to fit into everyday conversation, and your child can talk about them without ever considering that they are doing addition and subtraction.\n\nIf you have 3 of something and your child has four of that thing, you can discuss various possibilities. Would you have the same amount if you had one more? Would you have the same amount if your child has one less. Be playful with the idea. If your numbers are 3 and 5, you can talk about getting one more twice, or about one of you getting one more and the other getting one less.\n\n**Extend from 1 to 2:** When your child is ready, extend your child's understanding to what happens when you have two more or two less. There is no hurry to get to this, so please make sure your child first thoroughly understands one more and one less.\n\n**Games:** With this simple bit of arithmetic, you can start playing some games with adding and subtracting. A very simple one is to play the game of Nim with 1 and 2 using either addition or subtraction. Other games are Get Out of My House and Within 1 or 2": "**比看上去更重要:** 人們很容易認為這些想法是微不足道的、幾乎微不足道的步驟。然而，「多一個”和“少一個」的想法是加法和減法的早期重要步驟 。\n\n**上下計數:** 當你上下數數時，多一個和少一個與下一個數字和前一個數字的概念密切相關。雙嚮計數練習將幫助您的孩子輕鬆知道下一個數字是什麼，前一個數字是什麼。\n\n**加 1 和減 1:** 將這些想法與加減法結合起來，提出以下問題：「你現在有多少顆鵝卵石？如果我再加一顆，你現在有多少顆？如果我拿走一顆，你就少一顆，你現在有多少顆？」這些都是非常容易和自然的問題，可以融入日常對話中，你的孩子可以談論這些問題，而不必考慮他們正在做加減法。\n\n如果您有 3 件東西，而您的孩子有 4 件，您可以討論各種可能性。如果您多一件，您還會得到相同的數量嗎？如果您的孩子少一件，您還會得到相同的數量嗎？發揮一下這個想法。如果您的數字是 3 和 5，您可以談論兩次多得到一件，或者你們其中一個人多得到一件，另一個人少得到一件。\n\n**從 1 擴展到 2:** 當您的孩子準備好時，請讓您的孩子了解多兩個或少兩個會發生什麼。不必著急講這個，所以請確保您的孩子首先徹底理解多一個和少一個。\n\n**遊戲:** 掌握了這些簡單的算術知識後，你就可以開始玩一些加減遊戲了。最簡單的遊戲是使用加法或減法玩 1 和 2 的尼姆遊戲。其他遊戲包括《離開我的房子》和《差1或2》。",
  "2.7 Finger Add and Subtract to 5": "步驟17：手指加減到 5",
  "**Adding by counting:** For a long time your child has been doing adding problems by counting. If they were asked to add two things to three things, that was done by counting all five things. As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things. This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Using fingers:** Children of this age will benefit greatly from having manipulatives to use when doing addition. It helps cement their understanding of the numbers in terms of quantities. Of course, the manipulative that is always available to them is their fingers. When doing our example of adding two to three, they can put up two fingers on one hand, three fingers on the other hand, and bring the two hands together. Another way to do it is to raise two fingers on one hand, raise three more fingers on that same hand, and then see a total of five fingers raised.\n\n**Add 0 sometimes:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually for your child.\n\n**Subtracting up to 5:** The ideas behind practicing subtraction are similar to those for addition. If your child is going to subtract three from five, have your chid raise five fingers and then lower three of them. Their familiarity with one less and two less will probably make subtracting one and two very easy.\n\n**Subtract 0 and everything sometimes:** Mix in questions where you subtract 0 sometimes. Also mix in questions where you subtract everything. For example, if you have three bits of food and you eat all of them, how many do you have left?\n\n**Memorizing:** As you ask your child to do various adding and subtracting problems that come along, your child will become more and more familiar with them and will eventually memorize them. While it is desirable to eventually make the recall of these facts automatic and easy for your child, there is no hurry.\n\n**Other math facts:** During this time your child's exposure to adding won't be restricted to those whose sum is 5 or less, and that is fine. For example, your child will probably have learned to add 1 or 2 to all the numbers up to 10. Your child may also have begun to learn the adding twin facts, such as 3 + 3 or 4 + 4.": "**通過計數進行添加:** 長期以來，您的孩子一直在通過計數來解決加法問題。如果要求他們將兩件東西加到三件東西上，則通過計算所有五件東西來完成。隨著您的孩子掌握了「繼續計數」，部分計數被替換為從其中一個數字開始，例如本例中的 3，然後計算剩餘的兩個東西。這種計數經驗還使您的孩子能夠形象化和掌握「再加 1」和「再加 2」的概念，這使得 1 和 2 的加法變得容易得多。\n\n**使用手指:** 這個年齡段的孩子在做加法時如果能使用教具，將受益匪淺。它有助於鞏固他們對數字的數量理解。當然，他們隨時可以使用的教具就是手指。在做我們這個二加三的例子時，他們可以一隻手伸出兩根手指，另一隻手伸出三根手指，然後將兩隻手合在一起。另一種方法是一隻手伸出兩根手指，另一隻手伸出三根手指，然後看到總共伸出五根手指。\n\n**有時添加 0:** 有時還要加上 0。這很容易做到，而且對你的孩子來說，這在概念上很重要。\n\n**減去 5 以內:** 練習減法的思路與加法類似。如果你的孩子要從五中減去三，就讓他舉起五根手指，然後放下三根手指。他們對減一和減二的熟悉程度可能讓減一和減二變得非常容易。\n\n**有時減去 0 和所有值:** 有時，會混入減去 0 的問題。還會混入減去所有東西的問題。例如，如果你有三塊食物，你把它們全吃完了，你還剩下多少？\n\n**記憶:** 當你要求孩子做各種加減運算題時，孩子會越來越熟悉這些運算題，並最終記住它們。雖然希望孩子最終能夠自動輕鬆地記住這些運算題，但不必著急。\n\n**其他數學事實:** 在此期間，您的孩子接觸的加法不會僅限於總和為 5 或更少的數，這很好。例如，您的孩子可能已經學會了將 1 或 2 加到 10 以下的所有數字上。您的孩子可能還開始學習雙胞胎加法，例如 3 + 3 或 4 + 4。",

  "**Flash numbers:** A fun activity with your child is to flash a partially filled ten frame or a group of fingers on your two hands, and then have your child quickly recognize the quantity of things. If you use five or more fingers, put up five of those fingers on one hand so the two hands look like a ten frame. This activity also lays the groundwork for more easily using quantities on two hands for adding and subtracting.\n\n**Finger adding to 10:** If both numbers are five or less, put up the appropriate number of fingers on the two hands and count them up. Alternatively, put up the number of fingers for one of the numbers, and then count that many more fingers for the other number. When you are done, the total number of fingers shown will be the sum.\n\n**Finger subtracting to 10:** Do subtracting from numbers that are ten or less by putting up the number of fingers for the number being subtracted from. Then put down one finger at a time as you count up the number that is being subtracted. The resulting number of fingers left up is the answer.": "**閃光數字:** 一個有趣的活動是讓孩子在你的兩隻手上閃現一個部分填滿的十格或一組手指，然後讓孩子快速識別事物的數量。如果你使用五個或更多手指，請將其中五個手指放在一隻手上，這樣兩隻手看起來就像一個十格。這項活動還為更輕鬆地使用兩隻手進行加減運算奠定了基礎。\n\n**手指加到 10:** 如果兩個數字都是 5 或更少，則在兩隻手上伸出相應數量的手指並數數。或者，伸出其中一個數字的手指數量，然後再數另一個數字的手指數量。數完後，顯示的手指總數就是總和。\n\n**手指減到 10:** 減去十或更少的數字，舉起減去數字對應的手指數。然後每次放下一根手指，數出減去的數字。剩下的手指數就是答案。",

If you pair things up and then skip count them by 2's, you will reinforce how paired things come in twos.\n\n**Getting started with skip counting:** Introduce skip counting in two ways. One way is to take turns with your child as you count up to some number, alternating numbers as you go – one of you will be skip counting starting at 0, and the other will be starting at 1. After some practice, one of you stays silent and the other one counts as before, saying every other number.\n\nThe other way for your child to get used to skip counting is to count up to some number normally the first time. Then do that counting again by saying every other number softly. Continue this practice until the softly-spoken numbers are not spoken at all.\n\n**Start at numbers other than 0:** It is tempting to always start at 0. However, if you start at other numbers, such as 1, you will be helping your child with adding skills as well as multiplying and dividing skills.\n\n**Skip count downwards sometimes:** Skip counting downwards helps with subtracting skills and with dividing skills.": "**既快又有趣:** 嚮您的孩子展示這是一種有趣的計數方式，比按 1 計數要快得多。如果您將事物配對，然後跳過按 2 計數，您將強化配對事物如何以兩個為單位。\n\n**開始跳過計數:** 以兩種方式介紹跳數。一種方法是輪流和孩子一起數到某個數字，在數的過程中交替數數——你們中的一個從 0 開始跳數，另一個從 1 開始跳數。經過一些練習後，你們中的一個保持沈默，另一個像以前一樣數數，說出其他數字。\n\n讓孩子習慣跳過計數的另一種方法是，第一次正常地數到某個數字。然後輕聲說出每個其他數字，再次進行計數。繼續這種練習，直到輕聲說出的數字完全不被說出。\n\n**從 0 以外的數字開始:** 總是從 0 開始是很誘人的。但是，如果從其他數字開始，例如 1，您將幫助您的孩子掌握加法技能以及乘法和除法技能。\n\n**有時跳過嚮下計數:** 跳過嚮下計數有助於減法技能和除法技能。",

You can count by 2's from left to right to get to 4, and then add the 3 single dots. Or, you can see the 3 blank squares and count this as 3 less than 10.\n\n**Be playful:** Play with all the different ways you and your child can do the counting. Seeing different ways to get the answer will open your child's eyes that math is about exploring and play, and not about arriving at an answer in some preferred way. All these different ways of counting will also develop a deeper understanding of quantities for your child.\n\n**Additive approaches:** One way to count up a group of objects is to add up the different parts of the group. That's what we did in this ten frame example when we added up 5 from the top row to the 2 in the bottom row.\n\n**Skip counting:** You may see a repeated pattern when you add up the parts of a group.

  "3.1 Mental Adding by Counting On": "步驟21：通過計數進行心算",
  "**Gradual change:** As your child develops skill with small adding and subtracting problems, gradually shift over to doing more of these calculations mentally. Don't be in a hurry to memorize. This time spent calculating answers by seeing the relationships between numbers will pay off handsomely in terms of a much better feel and understanding of numbers. If your child masters these facts by grinding through repeated drills with flash cards, you will have thrown away this important opportunity.\n\n**Counting on:** Use 6 + 3 as an example of adding by Counting On.\n\nInitially, your child will want to do this using their fingers, and that is fine. Say \"6\" and have a closed fist to indicate 0. Next, count up \"7, 8, 9\" and raise one finger with each number. Stop at 9, when three fingers have been raised.\n\nOver time, using fingers with small addition problems will become less necessary. Your child will start to mentally see the change of 3 in going from 6 to 9, and will no longer need to use fingers – just as they no longer need fingers for adding 1 or 2.\n\n**Start from the larger number:** With experience, your child will start to realize that it is easier and faster to start with the larger of the two numbers. For example, it is easier to do 3 + 6 as 6 Counted On with 3 more than it is do it as 3 Counted On with 6 more. Part of making this choice is realizing that the results of 3 + 6 and 6 + 3 are the same. This important observation will mean learning only about half as many addition facts!": "**漸變:** 隨著您的孩子掌握了小加減運算的技能，逐漸轉嚮在心算中做更多這樣的計算。不要急於記住。花時間通過觀察數字之間的關係來計算答案，將帶來豐厚的回報，讓您對數字有更好的感覺和理解。如果您的孩子通過反複練習抽認卡來掌握這些事實，那麼您就浪費了這個重要的機會。\n\n**指望:** 使用 6 + 3 作為通過遞增計數進行加法的示例。\n\n最初，您的孩子會想用手指來做這件事，這冇問題。說「6」，並握緊拳頭錶示 0。接下來，數「7、8、9」，並在每個數字上舉起一根手指。當舉起三根手指時，停在 9 處 。\n\n隨著時間的推移，使用手指解決小加法問題將變得不那麼必要。您的孩子將開始在腦海中看到從 6 到 9 的 3 的變化，並且不再需要使用手指 - 就像他們不再需要手指來加 1 或 2 一樣。\n\n**從較大的數字開始:** 隨著經驗的積纍，您的孩子將開始意識到從兩個數字中較大的一個開始更容易、更快。例如，將 3 + 6 算成 6 加上 3 比將 3 加上 6 更容易。做出這一選擇的一部分是意識到 3 + 6 和 6 + 3 的結果相同。這一重要觀察意味著學習的加法知識隻相當於原來的一半！",
  "3.2 Mental Subtracting – Take Away": "步驟22：心算減法——拿走",
  "**Two kinds of subtraction:** There are two models for subtraction, and both are important. The first is taking away. If you are asked to subtract 3 things from 9 things, you will probably think of this as taking away or removing 3 of the things. The second model involves difference. The difference between two numbers is the distance between them . If you are asked to subtract 7 from 9, you are likely to do this be finding how far apart they are, what their difference is.\n\nBoth understandings of subtraction are needed and are useful. For mental arithmetic, having a choice of using take away or difference can make a big difference in the ease of the calculation. Additionally, some problems are more naturally understood as take away or difference problems.\n\n**Counting down:** Counting down is a natural way to do take away. Use 9 - 3 as an example of subtracting by counting down.\n\nAs with adding, your child may want to initially do this using their fingers, and that is fine. Say \"9\" and have a closed fist to indicate 0. Next, count down \"8, 7, 6\" and raise one finger with each number. Stop at 6, when three fingers have been raised.\n\nOver time, using fingers with small subtraction problems will become less necessary. Your child will start to mentally see the change of 3 in going from 9 to 6, and will no longer need to use fingers – just as they no longer need fingers for subtracting 1 or 2.\n\n**Subtracting 1 to 4:** With practice, your child will build up speed using this approach for subtracting the numbers from 1 to 4. Take your time and make sure everyone enjoys the process.": "**兩種減法:** 減法有兩種模型，兩種都很重要。第一種是減法。如果要求你從 9 個東西中減去 3 個東西，你可能會認為這是減去或移除了 3 個東西。第二種模型涉及差值。兩個數字之間的差值就是它們之間的距離。如果要求你從 9 中減去 7，你很可能會通過找出它們之間的距離以及它們的差值來做到這一點。\n\n兩種對減法的理解都是必要的，也是有用的。對於心算來說，選擇使用減法或差法會對計算的難易程度産生很大的影響。此外，有些問題更自然地被理解為減法或差法問題。\n\n**倒數:** 倒數是進行減法的自然方法。以 9 - 3 為例，通過倒數進行減法。\n\n與加法一樣，您的孩子最初可能想用手指來做，這冇問題。說「9」，握緊拳頭錶示 0。接下來，倒數「8、7、6」，每數一個數字就舉起一根手指。舉起三根手指後，停在 6 處。\n\n隨著時間的推移，用手指做小減法題的必要性將逐漸降低。您的孩子將開始在腦海中看到從 9 到 6 的 3 的變化，並且不再需要使用手指——就像他們不再需要手指來減去 1 或 2 一樣。\n\n**減去 1 到 4:** 通過練習，您的孩子將使用此方法加快從 1 到 4 的減法速度。慢慢來，確保每個人都享受這個過程。",
  "3.3 Mental Subtracting – Difference": "步驟23：心算減法 – 差值",
  "**Distance or gap size:** If you are asked to find the difference between two numbers, you are doing a subtraction problem. Finding the difference is understood as finding the distance between the numbers, and this can be calculated by asking what number needs to be added to span the gap between them.\n\n**Counting On:** Use finding the difference of 9 and 6 as an example. Calculate this by keeping track of how many numbers you use as you Count On from 6 to 9. As with the instructions for adding in a previous learning step, this can be done with or without fingers. If your child has been practicing adding problems, they can probably very quickly count \"7, 8, 9\" and see that the gap is 3.\n\n**Subtracting and adding:** Using Counting On to find the difference is a great way to see the connec- tion between adding and subtracting. When we Counted On starting at 6 to add 6 + 3, we wanted to find the result of Counting On three times. When we Counted On from 6 to find 9 - 6, we knew the result of 9 and wanted to find out what we needed to add to 6 to get there.\n\n**Differences of 1 to 4:** With practice, your child will build up speed using this approach for finding differences of sizes 1 to 4. Take your time and make sure everyone enjoys the process.": "**距離或間隙大小:** 如果你被要求找出兩個數字之間的差值，那麼你正在做一道減法題。找公幹值可以理解為找出數字之間的距離，這可以通過詢問需要添加什麼數字來跨越它們之間的差距來計算。\n\n**正數:** 以求 9 和 6 之間的差為例。通過記錄從 6 數到 9 時使用的數字數量來計算。與上一學習步驟中的加法說明一樣，這可以用手指或不用手指來完成。如果您的孩子一直在練習加法問題，他們可能可以非常快速地數出「7、8、9」，並發現差值為 3。\n\n**減法和加法:** 使用「數數」來求差是了解加法和減法之間聯係的好方法。當我們從 6 開始數數，將 6 + 3 相加時，我們想求出數數三次的結果。當我們從 6 開始數數，求出 9 - 6 時，我們知道結果 9，並想找出需要將 6 加上多少才能得到這個結果。\n\n**1 至 4 之間的差:** 通過練習，您的孩子將提高使用此方法尋找 1 到 4 大小差的速度。慢慢來，確保每個人都享受這個過程.",
  "3.4 Number Bonds": "步驟24: 數的分解組合",
  "**Part and whole:** Seeing a whole thing as being made up of its parts is an important developmental step for a child. The number bonds for a number, say 6, are all the ways of pairing two numbers that add up to 6. It is all the ways of taking the whole of 6 and breaking it into two parts. This reinforces an understanding of the connection between addition and subtraction as forming groups of fact families – a topic to be covered in an upcoming learning step.\n\n**What's missing?:** Let's continue using number bonds for 6 as our example. The number bonds for 6 are: 0 + 6, 1 + 5, 2 + 4, and 3 + 3. A child who has learned these well will then have little trouble answering the question: \"What do I need to add to 2 to get 6?\" They will know that 2 + 4 is a number bond for 6, so 4 is the part of 6 that is missing.": "**部分與整體:** 把一個整體看作是由其各個部分組成的，這是孩子發展過程中的一個重要步驟。數字組合，例如 6，是將兩個數字相加為 6 的所有方法。它是將 6 的整數部分分成兩部分的所有方法。這加強了對加法和減法之間聯係的理解，即形成事實係列組——這是即將學習的步驟中要介紹的主題。\n\n**少了什麼東西？:** 讓我們繼續以 6 的數字鍵為例。6 的數字鍵為：0 + 6、1 + 5、2 + 4 和 3 + 3。學好這些的孩子將很容易回答這個問題：「我需要在 2 上加多少才能得到 6？」他們會知道 2 + 4 是 6 的數字鍵，因此 4 是 6 中缺失的部分。",
  "**Ten frames:** Fluency with number bonds for all numbers up to about 12 is very useful for doing adding and subtracting, The number bonds that arise the most often are those for 10. Ten frames are designed to help visualize number bonds for 10. A ten frame with 7 dots in it makes it visually obvious that 7 + 3 is a number bond for 10.\n\n**Games and puzzles:** There are quite a few games and puzzles that involve number bonds. Sum Groups is a puzzle designed to practice number bonds. Many games, such as Memory Challenge and Go Fish, have versions that use target totals and thereby exercise number bonds.": "**十框:** 掌握所有數字（大約到12）的數的分解組合對於進行加法和減法非常有用。最常出現的數的分解組合是10的分解組合。十框被設計用來幫助將10的分解組合可視化。在一個十框中放入7個點，可以直觀地看到7 + 3是10的一個分解組合。\n\n**遊戲和謎題:** 有相當多的遊戲和謎題涉及數的分解組合。總和組是一個旨在練習數的分解組合的謎題。許多遊戲，如記憶挑戰和釣魚，都有使用目標總數的版本，從而練習數的分解組合。",
  "3.5 Place Value": "步驟25：位置值",
  "**Meaning for the numbers 10 to 20:** At first, the numbers above 9 can be thought of as just the next numbers that come along. There is nothing wrong with that, and that viewpoint will work just fine for a long time. Eventually, with numbers all the way up to 100 coming on the horizon, it will be time to Introduce your child to the role of 10 in the numbers from 10 to 20.\n\n**Adding and subtracting 10:** Start this introduction by helping your child learn how to add 10 to single-digit numbers and subtract 10 from double-digit numbers from 10 to 20.\n\n**Practice with physical quantities:** Find something you have a lot of – perhaps pebbles, sticks, or toothpicks. Let's use 3 and 13 as an example. If you place 13 things on a flat surface, you can separate them into one group of 10 and one group of 3. This demonstrates both that 3 + 10 is 13, and also that 13 - 10 is 3.\n\n**Numerals:** If your child is ready to use numerals, write down 13 = 10 + 3 and 13 - 10 = 3 as you do the demonstration just described. When we write a two-digit number, such as 13, the place on the left is the tens place and the place on the right is the ones place. Then tens place tells how many tens the number has, and the ones place how many ones it has. For 13, it is made up of 1 ten and 3 ones, so 13 = 10 + 3. As another example, 20 is made up of 2 tens and 0 ones.\n\n**It takes time:** Breaking up a number into tens and ones, particularly symbolically with written numbers, is a big conceptual step and you should expect this to take many demonstrations, many explanations, and lots of time. As with so many of these foundational elements, your child will absorb it eventually and there is no hurry.": "**數字 10 至 20 的含義:** 一開始，9 以上的數字可以被認為是接下來出現的數字。這冇有什麼錯，而且這種觀點在很長一段時間內都適用。最終，隨著 100 以內的數字的出現，是時候嚮你的孩子介紹 10 在 10 到 20 的數字中的作用了。\n\n**加減 10:** 首先幫助您的孩子學習如何將 10 加到個位數上，以及如何從 10 到 20 之間的兩位數中減去 10。\n\n**物理量的練習:** 找一些你有很多的東西——可能是鵝卵石、木棍或牙簽。我們以 3 和 13 為例。如果你將 13 件東西放在一個平麵上，你可以將它們分成一組 10 件和一組 3 件。這既錶明 3 + 10 等於 13，也錶明 13 - 10 等於 3。\n\n**數字:** 如果您的孩子已經準備好使用數字，請按照剛才的演示，寫下 13 = 10 + 3 和 13 - 10 = 3。當我們寫一個兩位數（例如 13）時，左邊的位置是十位，右邊的位置是個位。十位錶示該數字有多少個十位，個位錶示該數字有多少個個位。對於 13，它由 1 個十位和 3 個個位組成，因此 13 = 10 + 3。再舉一個例子，20 由 2 個十位和 0 個個位組成。\n\n**這需要時間:** 將數字分解為十位數和個位數，尤其是用書麵數字進行符號化，是概念上的一大進步，您應該預料到這需要很多演示、很多解釋和很多時間。與許多這些基礎元素一樣，您的孩子最終會吸收它，不必著急。",
  "3.6 Fact Families": "步驟26：事實家族",
  "**A family of facts:** Addition and subtraction facts are easily grouped into facts that are closely related. Take this family of facts for example: 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 - 3 = 2, and 5 - 2 = 3. The picture below shows how these are interconnected.\n\nUse this kind of picture with your child. It shows one group of 3 dots, another group of 2 dots, and all together there are 5 dots. You can add the groups of dots in either order – either as 3 + 2 or 2 + 3 – and get the same result. If you take the 5 dots and you cover over one group, say the group of 2, then it is clear why 5 - 2 = 3.": "**一係列事實:** 加法和減法事實很容易歸類為密切相關的事實。以這組事實為例：2 +3 = 5、3 + 2 = 5、5 - 3 = 2 和 5 - 2 = 3。下圖顯示了這些事實是如何相互關聯的。\n\n讓您的孩子使用這種圖片。它顯示一組 3 個點，另一組 2 個點，總共有 5 個點。您可以按任意順序添加點組 - ​​3 + 2 或 2 + 3 - 並得到相同的結果。如果您取 5 個點並覆蓋一組，比如 2 個點，那麼 5 - 2 = 3 的原因就很明顯了。",
  "**Adding and subtracting are related:** Fact families and their associated pictures make it very clear how closely tied together addition and subtraction are. One important part of their relationship is that they undo each other. If you start with 3 and add 2, and then subtract 2, you are back with having the original 3. Similarly, if you start with 5 and subtract 2, and then add 2, you are back to having the original 5.\n\n**Addition order doesn't matter:** Another important thing to reinforce about fact families is that they show that the order that addition is done in does not change the result. So, if your child is asked to do 4 + 8 and they prefer to do 8 + 4, then they can do that.": "**加法和減法是相關的:** 事實家族及其相關圖片清楚地錶明了加法和減法之間的緊密聯係。它們之間關係的一個重要部分是它們相互抵消。如果你從 3 開始，然後加 2，然後減 2，你就會回到原來的 3。同樣，如果你從 5 開始，然後減 2，然後加 2，你就會回到原來的 5。\n\n**添加順序無關緊要:** 關於事實係列，另一個需要強調的重要事項是，它們錶明加法的順序不會改變結果。因此，如果您的孩子被要求做 4 + 8，而他們更喜歡做 8 + 4，那麼他們可以這樣做。",
  "3.7 Adding Twins and Near Twins": "步驟27：添加雙胞胎和近雙胞胎",
  "**Children like them:** Adding twins are when a number is added to itself, such as 3 + 3. Children generally enjoy adding twins, so they learn them eagerly and readily. The sums are also the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's, so that helps to reinforce these adding facts.\n\n**A foundation for doubling:** Knowing adding twins quickly leads to knowing how to double. Suppose you ask your child to double 3. They know that doubling something means to take two if it. So, doubling 3 means 3 plus 3, which is 6.\n\n**Near twins:** A pair of numbers is a near twin if they are one apart, such as 3 + 4. Once your child knows their adding twins, near twins is an easy next step. Think of 3 + 4 as 3 + 3 + 1, so it is 1 more than 3 + 3. So, 3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7. Alternatively, think of 3 + 4 as (4 - 1) + 3, which is 1 less than 4 + 4. So, 3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7. Allow your child to pick whichever approach they prefer for each near twin, or have fun doing them both ways.\n\nThis technique of using a familiar math fact to figure out a closely related math fact is powerful. It will help with learning many math facts in the months to come. Take your time and make sure your child thoroughly understands how this works. To explain it, demonstrate how 3 objects and 4 objects can be split up as 3 objects plus 3 objects plus one more – being able to see and touch things at this age is very powerful.": "**孩子們對此很感興趣：** 雙胞胎加法是指將一個數字加到自身上，例如 3 + 3。孩子們通常喜歡雙胞胎加法，所以他們學起來很熱切、很快。加法結果也是以 2 為單位跳過計數時得到的數字，因此這有助於強化這些加法事實。\n\n**倍增的基礎:** 知道加倍後，很快就知道了如何加倍。假設你讓孩子把 3 加倍。他們知道把某數加倍意味著減去 2。所以，把 3 加倍意味著 3 加 3，也就是 6。\n\n**近雙胞胎:** 如果一對數字相差一個，那麼它們就是近似雙胞胎，例如 3 + 4。一旦您的孩子知道了他們的雙胞胎加法，近似雙胞胎就是下一步。將 3 + 4 視為 3 + 3 + 1，因此它比 3 + 3 多 1。因此，3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7。或者，將 3 + 4 視為 (4 - 1) + 3，比 4 + 4 少 1。因此，3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7。讓您的孩子為每個近似雙胞胎選擇他們喜歡的方法，或者享受同時使用這兩種方法的樂趣。\n\n這種使用熟悉的數學事實來推導密切相關的數學事實的方法非常有效。它將有助於在未來幾個月內學習許多數學事實。花點時間確保您的孩子徹底理解其工作原理。為了解釋這一點，演示如何將 3 個物體和 4 個物體拆分為 3 個物體加 3 個物體加 1 個物體——在這個年齡段能夠看到和觸摸東西是非常強大的。",
  "3.8 Multiply and Divide by 2": "步驟28：乘以 2 並除以 2",
  "**Connected concepts:** In the previous learning step we discussed doubling. This is connected to a surprising number of related concepts, as you will soon see.\n\n**Multiplying by 2:** Multiplying by 2 is the same as doubling. However, it uses interesting new wording that your child will need to get used to. When you first introduce the phrase of multiplying by 2, be sure to mix in the use of doubling from time to time to help with the transition. Your child will be getting used to the new words \"multiplying\" and \"times.\"\n\n**Half of something:** When something is doubled, such as 3 doubled is 6, then you can take half of the result and get back the original number. For example, suppose you picture 3 doubled as two rows of 3 things. Then taking half of those two matched rows is to take one of the rows, which is 3 things.\n\n**Equal sharing:** When you talk about taking half of something, you can combine that with the idea of sharing it equally among two people. If two people are to get equal shares, they will each get the same thing and that will be half of the original amount.\n\n**Dividing by 2:** If your child is comfortable with all the concepts so far in this learning step, then they are ready to talk about dividing! You can start talking about dividing something equally, or dividing it in two, or dividing by two. Mix together using all these phrases with your child – it will take time for them to absorb this new vocabulary. As far as the math is concerned, they have mastered all the ideas already!\n\n**Concrete examples:** Do lots of practice with each of these new ideas and words with groups of objects. Make your child's understanding be concrete rather than simply abstract. Anytime there is something to share among two people is a perfect time to practice. You can of course start extending this to sharing among more than two people if you like.\n\n**The beginning of multiplying and dividing:** As you have seen, this is the starting point of multi- plying and dividing. There are one or two new ideas, and a lot of new vocabulary. It's exciting to see your child step into this new part of the world!": "**相關概念:** 在上一個學習步驟中，我們討論了加倍。這與大量相關概念有關，您很快就會看到。\n\n**乘以 2:** 乘以 2 與加倍相同。但是，它使用了有趣的新措辭，您的孩子需要習慣。當您第一次介紹乘以 2 的短語時，請務必不時地混合使用加倍的用法以幫助過渡。您的孩子將習慣新詞「乘以」和「倍數」。\n\n**一半的東西:** 當某物翻倍時，例如 3 翻倍為 6，那麼你可以取結果的一半並返回原始數字。例如，假設你將 3 翻倍為兩行，每行 3 個東西。然後取這兩行匹配的一半就是取其中一行，也就是 3 個東西。\n\n**平等分享:** 當你說拿一半時，你可以把它和兩個人平等分享的想法結合起來。如果兩個人要得到平等的份額，他們每人都會得到同樣的東西，也就是原來數量的一半。\n\n**除以2:** 如果您的孩子已經熟悉了本學習步驟中的所有概念，那麼他們就可以開始談論除法了！您可以開始談論將某物均等地分成兩份或將其分成兩份。將所有這些短語與您的孩子混合使用——他們需要時間來吸收這些新詞匯。就數學而言，他們已經掌握了所有的概念！\n\n**具體例子:** 用一組物體對每個新想法和新詞語進行大量練習。讓孩子的理解具體化，而不是抽象化。任何時候兩個人之間有東西可以分享，都是練習的最佳時機。當然，如果你願意，你可以開始將分享擴展到兩個人以上。\n\n**乘法和除法的開始:** 正如您所看到的，這是乘法和除法的起點。有一兩個新想法，還有許多新詞匯。看到您的孩子踏入這個世界的新領域真是令人興奮！",
  "3.9 Skip Counting by 2's II": "步驟29：以 2 為單位跳過計數 II",
  "**New connections:** Your child started skip counting by 2's during Stage 2. Their skip counting is now going higher and faster, and it is also now connected with new ideas, such as with multiplying and with even and odd numbers.\n\n**Multiplying by 2:** For example, multiplying something by 2 means to take that many 2's. Suppose your child is calculating 5 times 2. This means adding 2 to itself 5 times, which is exactly what your child will get if they skip count by 2's 5 times starting at 0. Of course, they can also calculate this quantity by doubling the number, in this case 5.\n\n**Start anywhere and go up or down:** It is important to keep practicing skip counting by 2's starting anywhere and going up and down. This practice will be surprisingly helpful for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Get used to doing this practice anytime you have a somewhat large collection of things to count.\n\n**Even and odd numbers:** An even number is one that can be split in half evenly. It is a quantity that two people can share and have nothing left over. The odd numbers are the other numbers, the numbers that cannot be shared evenly. Even numbers are the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's starting at 0. Odd numbers are the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's starting at 1.\n\n**Skip count by other numbers:** If you like, this is a good time to start skip counting by other numbers. Skip counting by 10's, 11's, and 5's are good starting places.": "**新連接:** 您的孩子在第 2 階段開始以 2 為單位跳數。現在他們的跳數越來越高、越來越快，並且還與新概念聯係在一起，例如乘法、偶數和奇數。\n\n**乘以 2:** 例如，將某個數乘以 2 意味著取那麼多的 2。假設您的孩子正在計算 5 乘以 2。這意味著將 2 加到自身上 5 次，這正是您的孩子從 0 開始跳過 2 的 5 次計數時得到的結果。當然，他們也可以通過將數字加倍來計算這個數量，在本例中為 5。\n\n**從任意位置開始嚮上或嚮下:** 重要的是要不斷練習以 2 為單位跳數，從任意位置開始，然後不斷增加和減少。這種練習對於加、減、乘、除非常有用。每當您要數的東西比較多時，就習慣做這種練習。\n\n**偶數和奇數:** 偶數是可以平均分成兩半的數。它是兩個人可以共享而不會剩下的東西。奇數是其他數，即不能平均分配的數。偶數是從 0 開始以 2 為單位跳過計數得到的數。奇數是從 1 開始以 2 為單位跳過計數得到的數。\n\n**按其他數字跳過計數:** 如果你願意，現在正是開始用其他數字跳數的好時機。用 10、11 和 5 跳數都是不錯的起點。",
  "3.10 Strategy Games": "步驟30：策略遊戲 I",
  "**Developmental stage:** Strategy games are games where the players have choices that produce better or worse outcomes. These games have a lot to offer children. In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving. However, the difficulty with these is that they require rule following and a willingness to participate in organized play. If your child is not ready yet for this kind of play environment, please be patient and let them get to a developmental point where they are ready. There is plenty of time.\n\n**Be patient:** When children are first ready to play organized games and are introduced to a new game, you will probably need to be very patient. It could well be that the first ten times you attempt to play the game your child will have fun with all the pieces and do many things that have nothing to do with the game. This is a process. Your child needs to become familiar with the game and its pieces, and the novelty needs to wear off a bit. You will know when your child is ready and your patience has paid off.\n\n**Play around:** At first, it is likely that your child won't really have a sense of winning and losing, and won't understand that their choices make a difference. That's okay. You are just there to have fun together. Over time, as the game and its choices become more familiar, your child will start to see that their choices make a difference and that they care about those differences.\n\n**Invisible math sometimes:** Strategy games don't always involve numeric components, but they are mathematical anyway. Any strategy game offers many important learning opportunities, some mathematical and some not. As mentioned earlier, problem solving is high on the list of skills that are developed by these games. Critical thinking and logical communication are also being developed. The rule following and turn taking are very good for social-emotional learning.": "**發展階段:** 策略遊戲是玩家可以選擇産生更好或更壞結果的遊戲。這些遊戲為孩子們提供了很多東西。特別是，它們自然會激勵孩子們解決問題。然而，這些遊戲的難點在於它們需要遵守規則並願意參與有組織的遊戲。如果你的孩子還冇有準備好進入這種遊戲環境，請耐心等待，讓他們達到他們準備好的發展階段。時間還很充足。\n\n**要有耐心:** 當孩子們第一次準備好玩有組織的遊戲並被介紹給一個新遊戲時，你可能需要非常耐心。很可能在你嘗試玩遊戲的前十次中，你的孩子會對所有的棋子感到很有趣，並且做很多與遊戲無關的事情。這是一個過程。你的孩子需要熟悉遊戲及其棋子，新鮮感需要逐漸消退。你會知道你的孩子何時準備好了，你的耐心是否得到了回報。\n\n**玩一玩:** 一開始，您的孩子可能真的冇有輸贏意識，也不明白他們的選擇會帶來什麼不同。冇關係。你們隻是一起玩。隨著時間的推移，隨著遊戲及其選擇變得越來越熟悉，您的孩子將開始意識到他們的選擇會帶來什麼不同，並且他們會關心這些不同。\n\n**有時數學是看不見的:** 策略遊戲並不總是涉及數字部分，但它們無論如何都是數學的。任何策略遊戲都提供許多重要的學習機會，有些是數學的，有些不是。如前所述，解決問題是這些遊戲培養的技能中的重要技能。批判性思維和邏輯溝通也在發展。遵守規則和輪流做事對社交情感學習非常有益。",

  "4.1 Counting to 100": "步驟31：數到100",
  "**10's:** When your child's counting extends from 20 up to 100, the hard parts are the changes in 10's. Those are the parts to give special support and practice. Once your child knows the sequence of the 10's, it is usually very easy for them to fill in the changes in 1's. For example, they will quickly learn to count \"70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.\"\n\n**Skip count by 10's:** When your child gets stuck counting between 1 and 100, it is usually at a transition in 10's. Typical questions to help your child get unstuck are: \"What comes next after the 60's?\" or \"What comes before the 50's?\" Practice skip counting by 10's to help with this. If your child can produce the 10's from 0 to 100 forward and backward, then they will be ready to answer those questions about which 10's come next or before.\n\n**Use objects:** Make this counting have more meaning by practicing it using a large group of small objects, such as pebbles. Gather together 100 of these objects and put them in a big pile off to the side. As your child counts up from one, pull over one object at a time with each number and include it in the current group of objects. Each time a group of ten objects is formed, put that group together in a special tens area. As the numbers increase, the tens area will have more and more groups of tens. By the time your child is in the 50's, there should be five groups of ten and a small collection of left over ones.\n\nYou can also do this practice in reverse by starting with ten groups of tens and then taking away one at a time as your child counts down from 100.\n\n**Count both directions:** Children often become really good counting quickly and automatically upward from 1 to 100, but then have trouble counting in the opposite direction. Counting from 100 to 1 forces more thought about the 10's transitions and helps with understanding the numbers better in general.\n\n**100 number chart:** Having a ten by ten 100 number chart going from 1 to 100, or from 0 to 99, will help your child see the pattern of the numbers. It will make it particularly clear how the tens place stays the same for ten numbers and the ones place keeps changing.": "**10 的:** 當您的孩子從 20 數到 100 時，最難的部分是 10 的變化。這些是需要特別支援和練習的部分。一旦您的孩子知道了 10 的順序，他們通常很容易填寫 1 的變化。例如，他們會很快學會數「70、71、72、73、74、75、76、77、78、79」。\n\n**按 10 跳過計數:** 當您的孩子在 1 到 100 之間數數時遇到睏難，通常是在 10 的過渡階段。幫助您的孩子擺脫睏境的典型問題是：「60 之後是什麼？」或「50 之前是什麼？」練習以 10 為單位跳過計數以幫助解決這個問題。如果您的孩子可以從 0 到 100 正嚮和反嚮數出 10，那麼他們將準備好回答關於哪些 10 在下一個或之前的問題。\n\n**使用物體:** 通過使用一大堆小物體（如鵝卵石）進行練習，讓計數更有意義。收集 100 個這樣的物體，將它們堆放在一邊。當您的孩子從一開始數數時，每次拉一個帶有每個數字的物體，並將其包含在當前的物體組中。每當形成一組十個物體時，就將該組放在一個特殊的十位數區域。隨著數字的增加，十位數區域將有越來越多的十位數組。等您的孩子數到 50 時，應該有五組十位數和一小堆剩餘的個位數。\n\n您也可以反嚮練習，從十組十開始，然後隨著您的孩子從 100 倒數，一次減去一個。\n\n**計算兩個方嚮:** 孩子們通常能夠快速而自如地從 1 數到 100，但反過來數卻有睏難。從 100 數到 1 會迫使他們更多地思考 10 的過渡，並有助於更好地理解數字。\n\n**100 數字圖錶:** 擁有一張從 1 到 100 或從 0 到 99 的十乘十 100 數字錶，將幫助您的孩子看到數字的規律。它將特別清楚地說明十位數字保持不變，而個位數字不斷變化。",
  "4.2 Two-Digit Place Value": "步驟32：兩位數位值",
  "**Number meaning:** Seeing a two-digit number as some number of tens and ones is central to understanding and working with those numbers. Doing two-digit addition and subtraction requires fluency with the concepts of place value. Develop that understanding through lots of experiences with physical objects and written numbers.\n\n**Bundles of tens:** Take something you have lots of, make a large pile of it, and put some of them in a few bundles of ten. For example, out of that large pile ask your child to gather 23 of them. Then ask your child to group them in groups of ten. They will form two groups of ten and 3 singles. See what happens with the groups of ten in these 23 things as you put in some additional items or take some away, always making sure that there are no more than 9 single items at any time.\n\n**Expanded form:** The expanded form of a number is writing it as a sum of its place value parts. For example, 23 would be written as 20 + 3, and 256 would be written as 200 + 50 + 6. Practice with your child converting in both directions between a number's usual form and its expanded form. Point out that the expanded form of a number is the same as taking that many things and bundling them into groups of ten and have ones left over.\n\n**Counting with tick marks:** Counting using groups of five tick marks is a natural thing people like to do and is strongly related to place value. If you are counting 23 things with tick marks, you will end up with 4 bundles of 5 and 3 tick marks left over. Those 4 bundles of 5 can be reorganized as 2 bundles of 2 groups of 5, which is our expanded form view of 23.\n\n**Skip counting:** Skip counting by various numbers is a way to build mental practice with adding or subtracting single-digit and double-digit numbers. Although it is a great way to practice, this does require some mental steps that not every child will be ready for at this point – there is no hurry. Here are two examples. With lots of practice, these thinking steps will become automatic.\n\nSkip count upward by 8 starting at 23. Think of 23 as 20 plus 3 more. Using the number bonds for 10, 3 will need 7 more to make a group of 10. Use 7 out of the 8 being added so that 3 plus 7 forms another group of 10. So, 23 + 8 becomes 20 + 10 + 1, which is 31.\n\nSkip count downward by 5 starting at 23. Break up 5 into 3 and 2. To subtract 5, we will first take away 3 and then take away 2. 23 subtract 3 brings us to 20, which we will think of as 10 + 10. Subtracting the remaining 2 from one of those 10's leaves 8, so our answer is 10 + 8, which is 18.": "**數字含義:** 將兩位數視為十位數和個位數是理解和使用這些數字的關鍵。進行兩位數加減運算需要熟練掌握位值概念。通過大量使用實物和書麵數字的經驗來培養這種理解。\n\n**成捆的:** 拿出你有很多的東西，堆成一大堆，然後把其中的一些分成幾捆，每捆十個。例如，讓您的孩子從那一大堆中收集 23 件。然後讓您的孩子將它們分成十個一組。它們將形成兩組，每組十件，每組三件。看看當你放入一些額外的物品或拿走一些物品時，這 23 件物品中的十個組會發生什麼情況，始終確保任何時候的單件物品不超過 9 件。\n\n**展開形式:** 數字的展開形式是將其寫為其位值部分的總和。例如，23 可以寫為 20 + 3，256 可以寫為 200 + 50 + 6。與您的孩子一起練習在數字的正常形式和展開形式之間進行雙嚮轉換。指出數字的展開形式與將那麼多東西捆成十個一組並剩下個數相同。\n\n**用刻度線計數:** 使用 5 個刻度線組進行計數是人們喜歡做的一件自然的事情，並且與位值密切相關。如果您用刻度線計數 23 個東西，那麼您最終會得到 4 捆 5 個東西和 3 個剩餘的刻度線。這 4 捆 5 個東西可以重新組織成 2 捆 2 組 5 個東西，這就是我們對 23 的擴展形式視圖。\n\n**跳過計數:** 跳過各種數字的計數是一種通過加減一位數和兩位數來建立心理練習的方法。雖然這是一種很好的練習方法，但這確實需要一些心理步驟，並不是每個孩子現在都準備好了——不必著急。以下是兩個例子。經過大量練習，這些思考步驟將成為自動化的。\n\n從 23 開始，每次嚮上跳數 8。將 23 視為 20 加上 3。使用 10 的數字鍵，3 需要再加 7 才能組成 10 組。使用所加 8 中的 7，這樣 3 加 7 就形成另一個 10 組。因此，23 + 8 變成 20 + 10 + 1，即 31。\n\n從 23 開始，每次嚮下跳過 5 個數。將 5 分成 3 和 2。要減去 5，我們首先要減去 3，然後減去 2。23 減去 3 得到 20，我們將其視為 10 + 10。從其中一個 10 中減去剩下的 2 得到 8，所以我們的答案是 10 + 8，也就是 18。",
  "4.3 Finger Addition The Easy Way": "步驟33：添加手指",
  "**Counting On using fingers:** Any single-digit number can be added to any number using this method. This uses the child's hands to keep track of the single-digit number that is being added. It makes use of Counting On to find the final total, and also your child's skill with recognizing quantities of fingers.\n\n**Example:** Use 8 + 7 as an example. We could use either number as the number we start with, but it will be quicker and less work if we start with the larger number, which is 8 in this case. Start with no fingers raised and both hands in a closed fist. Your child is going to count starting at 8, and each time a new number is mentioned, your child will raise another finger. So, starting with \"8\" with no fingers raised, the child Counts On and says \"9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\" while raising one more finger each time. Your child will stop at 15 because they will recognize they have 7 fingers raised at that point.\n\n**Any starting number:** Notice that your child can use this method with any starting number. This example would have worked just as easily for adding 58 + 7.\n\n**It is reliable, but it will be replaced:** This will eventually be replaced by other methods, but for now this is reliable and is something your child can be assured will always give them the right answer any time they need it.": "**用手指計數:** 使用此方法可以將任何一位數加到任何數字上。這種方法使用孩子的手來跟蹤要添加的一位數。它利用計數來找到最終總數，以及您的孩子識別手指數量的技能。\n\n**例子:** 以 8 + 7 為例。我們可以使用任意一個數字作為起始數字，但如果我們從較大的數字開始，即本例中的 8，那麼速度會更快，工作量也會更少。開始時不要舉起手指，雙手握拳。您的孩子將從 8 開始數數，每次提到一個新數字時，您的孩子都會舉起另一根手指。因此，從「8」開始，不舉起手指，孩子繼續數數，說「9、10、11、12、13、14、15」，同時每次多舉起一根手指。您的孩子會在 15 處停止，因為他們會意識到自己在那時已經舉起了 7 根手指。\n\n**任意起始數字:** 請註意，您的孩子可以將該方法用於任何起始數字。此示例同樣適用於 58 + 7 的加法。\n\n**它很可靠，但將被取代:** 這種方法最終將被其他方法取代，但就目前而言，它是可靠的，並且可以確保您的孩子在需要時始終能得到正確的答案。",

  "**Two subtractions:** The two models for subtraction, take away and difference, are both important and both need to be practiced. Here are methods that use a child's hands to keep track of part of the calculation. As with finger addition using fingers, these methods use your child's skill with recognizing quantities of fingers. We'll use 14 - 8 as our example for both methods.\n\n**Take away with fingers:** This method uses counting down to take away a single-digit number from any number. Have your child start with two closed fists and say \"14.\" Counting down from 14, your child raises one more finger with each new number: \"13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.\" Your child will stop at 6 when they see they have 8 fingers raised.\n\n**Difference with fingers:** This method uses Counting On to find a single-digit difference between any two numbers.

  "4.5 Compensation for Add and Subtract": "步驟35：加減補償",
  "**Useful and easier than you think:** Compensation is a useful mental arithmetic tool for simplifying addition and subtraction calculations of all sizes. Understanding it also increases number sense for addition and subtraction. It is simpler than it sounds.\n\nFor example, suppose you were adding 99 + 15. You would recognize that 99 needs just one more to make 100, a number that is much easier to work with than 99. So you would move 1 from the 15 to the 99 – you would have the same total number of things, but they are distributed in a way that's easier to work with. This problem becomes 100 + 14, which is very easy to do. This is the kind of thing we'll be doing.\n\n**Compensation for addition:** The idea is to give or take some small amount to make one of the numbers easier to work with. We will typically be making one of the numbers into a multiple of 10. Suppose you are adding 8 + 7. The 8 just needs 2 more to become 10, so take that 2 away from the 7. This makes 8 + 7 into 10 + 5, which is easy. We could also have done this problem by giving 3 to the 7 to make it 10. In that case, we'd turn 8 + 7 into 5 + 10.\n\n**More compensation for addition:** There are other possibilities for using compensation in addition problems. Consider 6 + 8 for example. The 6 could give 2 to the 8 to make this problem 4 + 10. However, the 8 could give 1 to the 6 to make this 7 + 7, an adding twins problem. Challenge each other to think of different ways for doing a given adding problem.\n\n**Compensation for subtraction:** For subtraction, we will add the same amount or subtract the same amount from both numbers. This will keep the distance between them the same but will make them easier to work with. Typically that will mean turning the number we're subtracting into a multiple of 10. Suppose we are subtracting 13 - 8. If we add 2 to both numbers, then the distance between stays the same, but now we are subtracting 15 - 10, which is easy. Similarly, if we were asked to do 17 - 13, we could subtract 3 from both numbers and turn it into 14 - 10. Alternatively, we could subtract 10 from both numbers and turn it into 7 - 3.": "**比你想象的更實用、更簡單:** 補償是一種有用的心算工具，可以簡化各種大小的加減運算。理解它還可以提高加減運算的數字感。它比聽起來簡單得多。\n\n例如，假設您要將 99 + 15 相加。您會發現 99 隻需再加 1 即可得到 100，而 100 比 99 更容易處理。因此，您需要將 1 從 15 移到 99 —— 這樣一來，總數將保持不變，但它們的分佈方式更容易處理。這個問題變成了 100 + 14，這很容易做到。這就是我們要做的事情。\n\n**加減補償:** 其思想是增加或減少一些小數，使其中一個數字更容易處理。我們通常會將其中一個數字變成 10 的倍數。假設您要將 8 + 7 相加。8 隻需再增加 2 即可變成 10，因此從 7 中減去 2。這樣 8 + 7 就變成 10 + 5，這很容易。我們也可以通過將 3 加到 7 上使其成為 10 來解決這個問題。在這種情況下，我們會將 8 + 7 變成 5 + 10。\n\n**更多附加補償:** 在加法問題中，還有其他使用補償的可能性。以 6 + 8 為例。6 可以將 8 的乘積減去 2，使這個問題變成 4 + 10。但是，8 可以將 6 的乘積減去 1，使這個問題變成 7 + 7，這是一個加法雙胞胎問題。挑戰彼此，想出解決給定加法問題的不同方法。\n\n**補償減法:** 對於減法，我們將從兩個數字中加上或減去相同的量。這將保持它們之間的距離相同，但會使它們更容易處理。通常，這意味著將我們要減去的數字變成 10 的倍數。假設我們要減去 13 - 8。如果我們將 2 加到兩個數字上，那麼它們之間的距離保持不變，但現在我們要減去 15 - 10，這很容易。同樣，如果我們被要求做 17 - 13，我們可以從兩個數字中減去 3，然後將其變成 14 - 10。或者，我們可以從兩個數字中減去 10，然後將其變成 7 - 3。",
  "4.6 10 as a Midway Point": "步驟36：10 作為中間點",
  "**Number bonds for 10:** The number 10 is often a handy mental arithmetic midway point to use for doing addition and subtraction problems that involve numbers above 10. Your child should have a strong command of the number bonds for 10 to take full advantage of these methods.\n\n**Addition sums over 10:** Suppose your child is given the addition problem 5 + 7. The number bond for 10 using 7 is 3, so your child can use 3 of the 5 to get to 10. The remaining 2 of the 5 will bring the total to 12. The point was to break up the 5 into two pieces, 3 and 2 – one which got the 7 to 10, and the other gets added onto the 10. This problem could also have been done the other way. The 7 could have been broken up into 5 and 2 – the 5 would be added to the original 5 to get 10, and then the 2 would be added to 10 to get 12.\n\nNotice that this is similar to the thinking for doing addition compensation.\n\n**Subtracting from a number bigger than 10:** Let's use 12 - 7 as our example. We can do this as a take away or a difference problem.\n\nAs a take away problem, we'll use 2 of the 7 to get 12 down to 10. We then have 5 of the 7 left to take the 10 down to 5. We broke 7 into 2 and 5 to be able to use 10 as an intermediate stop along the way.\n\nAs a difference problem, the total distance between 12 and 7 is the distance between 12 and 10 plus the distance between 10 and 7. The distance between 12 and 10 is 2, and the distance from 10 and 7 is 3, so the total distance is 2 plus 3, which is 5.": "**10 的分解組合:** 數字 10 通常是一個方便的心算中間點，用於解決涉及 10 以上的數字的加減問題。您的孩子應該熟練掌握 10 的數字鍵，才能充分利用這些方法。\n\n**10 以上的加法:** 假設您的孩子要解決加法問題 5 + 7。用 7 得到 10 的數字組合是 3，因此您的孩子可以使用 5 中的 3 得到 10。剩下的 5 中的 2 將使總數達到 12。關鍵是將 5 分成兩部分，3 和 2 - 一部分將 7 加到 10，另一部分加到 10 上。這道題也可以用另一種方式來解決。7 可以分成 5 和 2 - 5 加到原來的 5 得到 10，然後 2 加到 10 得到 12。\n\n註意，這與做加法補償的思路類似。\n\n**從大於 10 的數字中減去:** 讓我們以 12 - 7 為例。我們可以將其作為一道帶走題或差分題來做。\n\n作為一個帶走的問題，我們將使用 7 中的 2 將 12 減少到 10。然後我們用剩下的 7 中的 5 將 10 減少到 5。我們將 7 分成 2 和 5，以便能夠使用 10 作為沿途的中間站。\n\n作為差分問題，12 和 7 之間的總距離為 12 和 10 之間的距離加上 10 和 7 之間的距離。12 和 10 之間的距離為 2，10 和 7 之間的距離為 3，因此總距離為 2 加 3，即 5。",
  "4.7 Skip Counting by 2's, 5's, and 10's": "步驟37：以 2、5、10 為單位跳過計數",
  "**The easy ones:** At this point your child should be very comfortable skip counting by 2's, starting from anywhere and going up or down. If your child has not started already, it is time to extend this to skip counting by other numbers. The two easiest ones are skip counting by 5's and 10's.\n\n**By 10's:** Not only is skip counting by 10's easy to do, it also provides practice with place value. Your child will quickly realize that, if they skip count by 10's starting at 3, all the numbers will have a 3 in the ones place and the only thing that changes is the tens place. If you have a 100 chart available, use it to show your child that all the numbers go down or up in one column of the chart.\n\n**By 5's:** After your child masters skip counting by 10's, it is time to do the 5's. When your child skip counts by 5's, they will be comforted to see that every other number is 10 apart, as if they were skip counting by 10's.\n\n**Experiment with others:** There is no hurry to do the other numbers. Skip counting by 9's can be fun because the ones place gets one smaller and the tens place gets one bigger with each step.

If you are to double some number, say 4, ask your child to multiply it by 2 or ask them what 2 times 4 is. They have all the tools they need, they just need to adjust to the new wording.\n\n**Skip counting is multiplying:** If your child skip counts by 5's seven times starting at 0, your child will have seven 5's.

This is a big work saver and it allows your child to pick their favorite way to multiply things. For example, if they want to calculate 2 times 5 by doubling 5, that's fine.

  "**The value of these games:** Strategy games are games where the players have choices that produce better or worse outcomes. These games have a lot to offer children mathematically, even when there is no explicit numerical content. In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving.\n\n**An introduction to Nim:** Now that your child has been playing strategy games for a while, it is time to look into how to get more out of them. Let's use the game of Nim as an example. This game has some very simple rules: Pick a starting number, say 10, and a person to go first. Players alternate turns choosing to subtract 1 or 2 from the running total. The person who reaches 0 wins. The arithmetic is simple enough, but the strategy is challenging.\n\n**Learning from experience:** If you imagine you are playing any game against an extremely capable opponent, the game becomes a puzzle. How can I find the move that let's me have my best chance of winning no matter how well my opponent plays? One strategy is to play the game many times and pay attention to what seems to work and what doesn't. This approach is a good start and it does provide the opportunity for observation and insights. This can be a slow method of learning, and it may be very hard to find patterns in complicated games – imagine all the possibilities if we picked the starting number of 100 for Nim!\n\n**Solving Nim:** Can we look ahead a few moves and figure out good moves that way? That is hard to do starting at 10. If we start at 5, it's pretty easy to do. If we subtract 2, the new number will be 3. No matter whether the other play subtracts 1 or 2 at this point, we will win. So, if we are at the number 5, we know how to win. What happens with other small starting numbers? Can we find a pattern that will tell us which starting numbers will be winners and which will be losers? Can we explain why that pattern is true?\n\n**The goal:** If we follow this line of attack, we will completely solve how to play the game of Nim. What worked for Nim may or may not work for another game. This is problem solving, and each new problem can bring fresh challenges and a need for new ideas. And that is the fun. Share this attitude of puzzling and being challenged to your child. As they play a strategy game, discuss with them their ideas about what would make for a better or worse move at that moment. The point isn't so much to find the perfect move as it is to enjoy looking for it and having a discussion about it with people who they can enjoy sharing ideas with.": "**這些遊戲的價值:** 策略遊戲是玩家可以選擇更好或更壞結果的遊戲。這些遊戲在數學方麵為孩子們提供了許多東西，即使冇有明確的數字內容。特別是，它們自然而然地激勵孩子們解決問題。\n\n**尼姆遊戲簡介:** 現在您的孩子已經玩策略遊戲一段時間了，是時候研究如何從中獲得更多樂趣了。讓我們以 尼姆遊戲為例。這個遊戲有一些非常簡單的規則：選擇一個起始數字，比如 10，然後選擇一個人先走。玩家輪流選擇從纍計總數中減去 1 或 2。減去 0 的人獲勝。算術很簡單，但策略很有挑戰性。\n\n**從經驗中學習:** 如果你想象自己正在與一個非常有能力的對手玩遊戲，那麼遊戲就會變成一個難題。無論對手玩得多好，我如何才能找到讓我有最大獲勝機會的舉動？一種策略是多次玩遊戲，並註意哪些似乎有效，哪些無效。這種方法是一個很好的開始，它確實提供了觀察和洞察的機會。這可能是一種緩慢的學習方法，而且在複雜的遊戲中可能很難找到模式——想象一下，如果我們為 尼姆遊戲選擇的起始數字是 100，那麼所有的可能性！\n\n**解決尼姆遊戲:** 我們能否預測幾步並以此找出好的舉動？從 10 開始很難做到這一點。如果我們從 5 開始，這很容易做到。如果我們減去 2，新的數字將是 3。無論此時對方是減去 1 還是 2，我們都會贏。所以，如果我們處於數字 5，我們就知道如何取勝。其他較小的起始數字會發生什麼？我們能否找到一種模式來告訴我們哪些起始數字會贏，哪些會輸？我們能解釋為什麼這種模式是正確的嗎？\n\n**目標:** 如果我們遵循這條攻擊路線，我們將完全解決如何玩 尼姆遊戲的問題。對尼姆遊戲有效的方法可能對其他遊戲也有效，也可能無效。這就是解決問題的方法，每個新問題都會帶來新的挑戰和對新想法的需求。這就是樂趣所在。嚮您的孩子分享這種睏惑和接受挑戰的態度。當他們玩策略遊戲時，與他們討論他們的想法，看看在那一刻什麼會更好或更壞。重點不在於找到完美的舉動，而是享受尋找它並與可以與他們分享想法的人討論它。",

  "5.1 3-Digit Place Value": "步驟41：3位數",
  "**Many objects:** Relating math concepts to physical objects is often the best approach for young children. The difficulty here is that it is not so easy to have hundreds of objects in the first place, and it can also be unwieldy to deal with such a large collection. In addition to having groups of ones and tens of some object, one strategy is to use symbolic place holders for large groups, such as 100s. You could have several pieces of paper or wood on which you have written \"100.\"\n\n**Use objects:** Practice having your child represent various quantities using objects grouped in ones, tens, and hundreds. For example, ask how 325 would be represented using these objects. Include examples such as 206, 430, and 500 that have zero things in one or more categories. Also, lay out collections of ones, tens, and hundreds and ask your child to name the number for this quantity.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Once your child is thoroughly comfortable with the connection between numbers and their quantities, start using numerals and expanded form to represent the numbers. Take a number, such as 325, for example. Represent it with quantities for hundreds, tens, and ones, and then use the quantity representation to write the number in expanded form as 325 = 300 + 20 + 5. Do this same practice in the opposite direction by writing 100 + 40 + 6, representing it with physical groups of hundreds, tens, and ones of objects, and then asking what the total number is.": "**許多物體:** 對於年幼的孩子來說，將數學概念與實物聯係起來往往是最好的方法。這裏的睏難在於，一開始就很難擁有數百個物體，而且處理如此龐大的集合也很麻煩。除了擁有一組個數和十個個數的物體外，一種策略是使用符號佔位符來錶示大組，例如 100 個。你可以準備幾張紙或木頭，上麵寫上「100」。\n\n**使用物體:** 練習讓您的孩子使用按個位數、十位數和百位數分組的物體來錶示各種數量。例如，詢問如何使用這些物體錶示 325。包括 206、430 和 500 等示例，這些示例在一個或多個類別中冇有東西。此外，列出個位數、十位數和百位數的集合，並讓您的孩子說出這個數量的數字。\n\n**使用擴展形式:** 一旦您的孩子完全理解了數字和數量之間的聯係，就可以開始使用數字和擴展形式來錶示數字。以 325 為例。用百位數、十位數和個位數錶示它，然後使用數量錶示法以擴展形式寫出數字，即 325 = 300 + 20 + 5。以相反的方嚮進行同樣的練習，寫出 100 + 40 + 6，用物體的百位數、十位數和個位數的物理組來錶示它，然後詢問總數是多少。",
  "5.2 Double-Digit Add and Subtract": "步驟42：兩位數加/減",
  "**Single digit:** A gentle introduction to working with two two-digit numbers is to have one of them be a single-digit number. One of the best ways to practice adding or subtracting a single-digit number with a double-digit number is to do skip counting using various skip sizes, going up or down, and starting at any number. The following methods for two two-digit numbers will of course work when one of the numbers is a single-digit number.\n\n**Use objects:** Grounding your child's understanding by using physical objects is always a good idea. Start by representing both of the numbers with groups of tens and ones.\n\n**Adding:** If you are adding the two numbers, put all the groups together and discuss the result. If you are adding two numbers, such as 23 and 45, that is all you need to do. However, if you are adding 23 and 48, the two groups of ones form at least a group of ten. Talk about how that changes the total number of tens you have from 6 to 7. This is called regrouping.\n\n**Subtracting:** If you are subtracting, start by removing the tens being subtracted from the bigger number and then attempt to remove the appropriate number of ones. For example, if you are subtracting 23 from 45, then there are enough ones and you are done. If there are not enough ones, such as if you are subtracting 28 from 45, then discuss how one of the groups of tens needs to be broken up and included with the ones. The original grouping of 45 as 4 tens and 5 ones becomes a grouping of 3 tens and 15 ones. This is also called regrouping.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Use objects for double-digit adding and subtracting until your child thoroughly understands the process and why regrouping makes sense when it is needed. At this point, move to representing the adding and subtracting with numbers written in expanded form. When working with numbers in expanded form, the process and the steps are exactly the same as they were when you were working with groups of tens and ones – and that is the point.\n\n**Making it automatic:** Over time and with lots of practice, your child will stop needing to use groups of tens and ones or expanded form. However, as with so many other things, there is no hurry getting to that point – it will come with practice.": "**個位數:** 簡單介紹一下如何操作兩個兩位數，其中一個是單數。練習用兩位數加或減一位數的最佳方法之一是使用各種跳躍大小進行跳躍計數，嚮上或嚮下，從任意數字開始。當其中一個數字是單數時，以下兩個兩位數的方法當然有效。\n\n**使用物體:** 使用實物來鞏固孩子的理解始終是一個好主意。首先用十位數和個位數來錶示這兩個數字。\n\n**添加:** 如果要將兩個數字相加，請將所有數字組合在一起並討論結果。如果要將兩個數字相加，例如 23 和 45，那麼隻需這樣做即可。但是，如果要將 23 和 48 相加，那麼兩組 1 至少會形成一組 10。討論一下這會如何將您擁有的 10 的總數從 6 變為 7。這稱為重組。\n\n**減法:** 如果要減法，首先從較大的數字中減去要減去的十位，然後嘗試減去適當數量的個位。例如，如果要從 45 中減去 23，那麼個位就足夠了，您就完成了。如果個位不夠，例如要從 45 中減去 28，那麼討論如何將十位組中的一組拆分並包含在個位中。45 的原始分組為 4 個十位和 5 個個位，變為 3 個十位和 15 個個位。這也稱為重新分組。\n\n**使用擴展形式:** 使用物體進行兩位數加減運算，直到您的孩子徹底理解該過程以及為什麼在需要時重新分組是有意義的。此時，轉到用展開形式的數字錶示加減運算。當使用展開形式的數字時，過程和步驟與使用十位數和個位數組時完全相同 - 這就是重點。\n\n**實現自動化:** 隨著時間的推移和大量的練習，你的孩子將不再需要使用十位和個位或擴展形式。然而，就像其他許多事情一樣，不必著急達到這一點——它會隨著練習而來。",

It is also very helpful for getting better at mental addition and subtraction. One of the nice things about skip counting is that it can be done anywhere and at any time that you have some spare time.\n\n**Patterns on a 100 chart:** Look for patterns that show up as your child skip counts. This is most easily done using a 100 chart, but you can also do it by writing the numbers in a column and watching what happens to the ones and tens digits as they march down the column. Some numbers, such as 8 and 9, have interesting patterns in their ones digits, and other numbers, such as 3, are not as interesting.\n\n**Make it fun:** This is something you can make into an activity to do with two or more people.

It also can make it easier to learn how to multiply by 5.\n\nThe 5's can either be learned by skip counting by 5 until they become automatic, or they can be learned using the 10's. If you multiply 6 times 5, that will give you half as many 10's. Half of 6 is 3, so the answer is 30. If you multiply 7 times 5, you need to put one of the 5's off to the side and proceed as you would for 6 times 5. The answer for 6 times 5 is 30, and then adding in the 5 held in reserve gives the answer of 35.\n\n**Multiplying by 2, 4, and 8:** These three can be done with lots of doubling. Your child should have had lots of practice with doubling and multiplying by 2. Multiply by 4 either by skip counting or by doubling the answer from multiplying by 2. For example 4 times 3 is twice as much as 2 x 3, so the answer is 6 doubled, which is 12. Multiply by 8 by skip counting by 8 or by doubling the answer from multiplying by 4.": "**良好的框架:** 這些數字通常很容易學，而且一旦學會，它們就可以為學習剩餘的數字提供一個很好的框架。\n\n**乘以 5 和 10:** 學會如何乘以 10 很容易，這對於理解位值很重要。它還可以使學習如何乘以 5 變得更容易。\n\n5 可以通過跳過 5 的計數來學習，直到它們成為自動的，或者可以使用 10 來學習。如果你將 6 乘以 5，那麼你將得到 10 的一半。6 的一半是 3，所以答案是 30。如果你將 7 乘以 5，你需要將其中一個 5 放在一邊，然後像 6 乘以 5 那樣繼續。6 乘以 5 的答案是 30，然後加上保留的 5 得到答案 35。\n\n**乘以 2、4 和 8:** 這三項可以通過多次加倍來完成。您的孩子應該已經練習過多次加倍和乘以 2。乘以 4 可以通過跳過計數或將乘以 2 的答案加倍來實現。例如，4 乘以 3 是 2 x 3 的兩倍，因此答案是 6 的兩倍，即 12。乘以 8 可以通過跳過計數 8 或將乘以 4 的答案加倍來實現。",

  "**Several strategies:** These are grouped here because they can be done with the idea of using one more or one less, which is described in a moment. However, several of these can be done in other ways. They can all be done with skip counting, if your child prefers that approach. Multiplying by 4 is the double of multiplying by 2. Multiplying by 6 is the double of multiplying by 3. Multiplying by 11 is quite simple and barely needs any practice.\n\nMultiplying by 9 has a special rule, that some children enjoy. Use 6 times 9 as an example. For the answer, put one less than the number in the tens place (which is 5), and subtract the tens place from 9 to get the ones place (which is 4). So 6 times 9 is 54. As you'll see, this is no different than subtracting 6 from 6 times 10, but somehow it feels like more fun.\n\n**One more and one less:** Use the idea of one more or one less to learn these based on other numbers you now know how to multiply by. The numbers 3, 6, and 11 are one more than numbers you already know. For example, 6 times 7 is one more 7 than 5 times 7. So 6 times 7 is 7 + 35, which is 42.\n\nThe numbers 4 and 9 are one less than numbers you already know. For example, 4 times 7 is one less 7 than 5 times 7. So 4 times 7 is 35 - 7, which is 28.": "**幾種策略:** 這些被歸類在這裏是因為它們可以通過多一或少一的方法來做，稍後會介紹。但是，其中一些可以用其他方式來完成。如果您的孩子喜歡這種方法，它們都可以用跳數來完成。乘以 4 是乘以 2 的兩倍。乘以 6 是乘以 3 的兩倍。乘以 11 非常簡單，幾乎不需要任何練習。\n\n乘以 9 有一個特殊規則，有些孩子很喜歡。以 6 乘以 9 為例。答案是，在十位上放置一個比數字少的數字（即 5），然後用 9 減去十位得到個位（即 4）。所以 6 乘以 9 等於 54。正如你所見，這與從 6 乘以 10 中減去 6 冇什麼不同，但不知何故感覺更有趣。\n\n**多一個，少一個:** 使用多一或少一的思想，根據你現在知道如何乘以的其他數字來學習這些。數字 3、6 和 11 比你已經知道的數字多一。例如，6 乘以 7 比 5 乘以 7 多一個 7。所以 6 乘以 7 等於 7 + 35，也就是 42。\n\n4 和 9 比您已知的數字少 1。例如，4 乘以 7 比 5 乘以 7 少 1。因此 4 乘以 7 等於 35 - 7，也就是 28。",

It is far more important that you make this fun and that your child enjoys seeing how the various multiplication facts in- terrelate – which ones are doubles or halves of others, which ones are one more or one less than others, and which ones have interesting patterns with their ones digits.\n\n**Limited and fun flashcards:** Used sparingly and lightheartedly, flash cards, or something similar, can be helpful. If your child has trouble remembering a handful of the multiplication facts, make a list of just those facts so they can be briefly practiced on their own.": "**缺失的部分:** 如果您的孩子記住了剩下的一兩個乘法事實，他們就會知道所有個位數的乘法！例如，他們可能還不知道 7 乘以 7 等於多少。與雙胞胎加法類似，平方對許多孩子來說是一個有趣的類別，這些可以自己練習。保持所有這些練習輕鬆愉快，不要太以目標為導嚮。\n\n**把所有內容整合在一起並記住:** 一點一點地，通過反複練習和接觸，你的孩子會記住所有的乘法事實。雖然讓這些最終對你的孩子來說變得容易和自動很重要，但這並不一定需要很快發生。更重要的是你要讓這件事變得有趣，讓你的孩子喜歡看到各種乘法事實是如何相互關聯的——哪些是其他乘法事實的兩倍或一半，哪些比其他乘法事實多一或少一，哪些乘法事實的個位數有有趣的模式。\n\n**有限且有趣的抽認卡:** 謹慎而輕鬆地使用抽認卡或類似的東西會很有幫助。如果您的孩子很難記住一些乘法錶，請列出這些乘法錶，以便他們可以自己進行簡短的練習。",
  "5.7 Divisors, Factors, and Multiples": "步驟47：除數、因數和倍數",
  "**Divisors and factors:** If a number evenly divides into a number, then it is called a divisor of it. For example, 3 is a divisor of 6 because 3 divides into 6 exactly 2 times. 4 is not a divisor by 6 because it goes into it 1 1/2 times. The word factor means the same thing as divisor.\n\n**Common divisors:** In some mathematical situations, particularly with simplifying fractions, it is useful to find numbers that evenly divide two given numbers. Such numbers are called common divisors or common factors. The common divisors of 20 and 8 are 1, 2, and 4. You may enjoy exploring together why all the common divisors for a pair of numbers are divisors of the greatest of the common divisors.\n\n**Multiples:** A multiple of a number is anything that can be produced by multiplying the number by a whole number. For example, some multiples of 6 are 0, 6, 12, and 18. Notice that any multiple of a number has that number as a divisor. For example, each of the multiples of 6 has 6 as a divisor.\n\n**Common multiples:** A number which is a multiple of two given numbers is said to be a common multiple for them. Some common multiples of 6 and 4 are 0, 12, 24, and 36. Notice that all the common multiples are multiples of the least of the positive common multiples. Common multiples will be useful in adding and subtracting fractions.\n\n**Introduce these words:** Slowly introduce these new words to your child as you discuss situations that involve multiplication and division. They are useful words that simplify many discussions once the words are understood.": "**除數和約數:** 如果一個數能整除另一個數，那麼它就被稱為該數的約數。例如，3 是 6 的約數，因為 3 能整除 6 的 2 次。4 不能整除 6，因為它能整除 6 的 1 1/2 次。因數與約數含義相同。\n\n**公約數:** 在某些數學情況下，特別是在簡化分數時，找到可以整除兩個給定數字的數字很有用。這樣的數字稱為公約數或公因數。20 和 8 的公約數是 1、2 和 4。您可能會喜歡一起探索為什麼一對數字的所有公約數都是最大公約數的公約數。\n\n**倍數:** 一個數的倍數是該數與一個整數相乘後得到的數。例如，6 的一些倍數是 0、6、12 和 18。請註意，任何數的倍數都以該數為除數。例如，6 的每個倍數都以 6 為除數。\n\n**公倍數:** 如果一個數是兩個給定數的倍數，則稱該數為這兩個數的公倍數。6 和 4 的一些公倍數是 0、12、24 和 36。請註意，所有公倍數都是最小正公倍數的倍數。公倍數在加減分數時很有用。\n\n**介紹這些詞:** 在討論涉及乘法和除法的情況時，慢慢嚮孩子介紹這些新詞。一旦理解了這些詞，它們就很有用，可以簡化許多討論。",
  "5.8 Primes, Composites, and Powers": "步驟48：素數、合數和冪",
  "**Primes:** Primes are central to understanding multiplication and division of whole numbers. As you will see, primes are the building blocks of numbers using multiplication. A prime number is a number larger than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and itself. The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are the first few prime numbers.\n\n**Composites and 1:** There are three kinds of positive whole numbers: 1 (which is called a unit), primes, and composites. Composites can be thought of as being constructed from primes. For example, 12 is 2 times 2 times 3. Every number larger than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely written as a product of two or more primes.\n\n**Prime factorizations:** Getting to know prime factorizations really well will be very helpful for many parts of the math your child is about to learn. Repeating the prime factorizations of the numbers up to 20, or even 30, is a good exercize for getting to know these factorizations. Simply go through the list of numbers in order like this: 1 - unit, 2 - prime, 3 - prime, 4 - 2 times 2, 5 - prime, 6 - 2 times 3, 7 - prime, 8 - 2 times 2 times 2, 9 - 3 times 3, and 10 - 2 times 5.\n\n**Powers:** Prime factorizations often involve repeated prime factors, so this is a good time to learn about powers and to practice them. It is quicker and easier to understand to say \"2 to the fourth\" than it is to say \"2 times 2 times 2 times 2.\" 2 squared means 2 times 2, and 2 cubed means 2 times 2 times 2.": "**素數:** 素數對於理解整數的乘法和除法至關重要。如你所見，素數是使用乘法的數字的構成要素。素數是大於 1 的數字，其唯一除數是 1 和它本身。數字 2、3、5、7 和 11 是前幾個素數。\n\n**合數和 1:** 正整數有三種：1（稱為單位）、質數和合數。合數可以看作是由質數構成的。例如，12 是 2 乘以 2 乘以 3。每個大於 1 的數字要麼是質數，要麼可以唯一地寫成兩個或多個質數的乘積。\n\n**質因數分解:** 真正了解質因數分解對您的孩子即將學習的數學的許多部分都非常有幫助。重複對數字進行質因數分解，直到 20 甚至 30，是了解這些因數分解的一個很好的練習。隻需按以下順序瀏覽數字列錶：1 - 單位，2 - 質數，3 - 質數，4 - 2 乘以 2，5 - 質數，6 - 2 乘以 3，7 - 質數，8 - 2 乘以 2 乘以 2，9 - 3 乘以 3，10 - 2 乘以 5。\n\n**冪:** 質因數分解通常涉及重複的質因數，因此這是學習冪並練習冪的好時機。說“2 的四次方”比說“2 乘以 2 乘以 2 乘以 2”更快、更容易理解。2 的平方意味著 2 乘以 2，2 的立方意味著 2 乘以 2 乘以 2。",
  "**Factors and factor trees:** For larger numbers, it may not be immediately obvious what the prime factorization is. For these numbers, find one of the factors and use that to break apart the problem into easier pieces. For example, 54 is 9 times 6. Because 9 is 3 squared and 6 is 2 times 3, we can put those together to have 54 is 2 times 3 cubed. This process is sometimes called making a factor tree, and pictured above are three possible ways for creating a factor tree for 54.": "**因子和因子樹:** 對於較大的數字，質因數分解可能不是立即顯而易見的。對於這些數字，找到其中一個因數，並利用它將問題分解成更簡單的部分。例如，54 是 9 乘以 6。因為 9 是 3 的平方，而 6 是 2 乘以 3，所以我們可以將它們放在一起得到 54 是 2 乘以 3 的立方。這個過程有時被稱為製作因數樹，上圖是創建 54 的因數樹的三種可能方法。",
  "5.9 Fact Families II": "步驟49：事實家族II",
  "**Families:** In Stage 3 we explored the fact families that connect addition and subtraction, and we saw how useful they are in understanding the interconnections between those two operations. Similar to what was done for addition and subtraction, group multiplication and division facts by families to gain a deeper understanding of them. For example, 3 x 4 = 12, 4 x 3 = 12, 12 / 3 = 4, and 12 / 4 = 3 form a fact family.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing are related:** For the 3 x 4 = 12 fact family, visualize this interconnection using a rectangle that is 3 by 4. The area of this rectangle is 12, which is 3 times 4 or 4 times 3 – its width times its length. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of width 3, the length must be 4. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of length 4, its width must be 3. All these facts are tied together.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing undo each other:** Let's continue to use the example of 3 times 4. If we start with 3 and multiply it by 4 we arrive at 12. If we then take 12 and divide it by 4, the result is back to 3. Multiplying by 4 and then dividing by 4 gets back to where we started.\n\nSimilarly, if we take 12 and divide by 4 the answer is 3. If we then multiply 3 by 4 the answer is 12, which is where we started. Dividing by 4 and then multiplying by 4 returns things to the beginning.": "**家庭:** 在第 3 階段，我們探索了連接加法和減法的事實係列，並看到了它們對於理解這兩個運算之間的相互聯係有多大用處。與對加法和減法所做的類似，將乘法和除法事實按係列分組，以加深對它們的理解。例如，3 x 4 = 12、4 x 3 = 12、12 / 3 = 4 和 12 / 4 = 3 形成一個事實係列。\n\n**乘法和除法是相關的:** 對於 3 x 4 = 12 這一事實係列，使用一個 3 x 4 的矩形來形象化這種相互聯係。這個矩形的麵積是 12，即 3 乘以 4 或 4 乘以 3（即其寬度乘以長度）。要得到寬度為 3 的矩形的麵積為 12，其長度必須為 4。要得到長度為 4 的矩形的麵積為 12，其寬度必須為 3。所有這些事實都聯係在一起。\n\n**乘法和除法互相抵消:** 我們繼續使用 3 乘以 4 的例子。如果我們從 3 開始並將其乘以 4，則結果為 12。如果我們隨後將 12 除以 4，結果又回到 3。乘以 4 然後除以 4 又回到我們開始的位置。\n\n類似地，如果我們取 12 並除以 4，答案是 3。如果我們再將 3 乘以 4，答案是 12，也就是我們開始的地方。除以 4 然後乘以 4 會回到開始的地方。",
  "5.10 Single-Digit Division": "步驟50：一位數除法",
  "**You have prepared the way:** Your work with skip counting, learning multiplication facts, and fact families will smooth the way for dividing both with and without remainders. All those skills should be well mastered and understood before starting in on general single-digit division.\n\n**No remainder:** Division problems where the divisor goes in evenly without a remainder are mostly done by your child recognizing the corresponding multiplication fact. For example, if they are asked to divide 36 by 4, then remembering that 4 times 9 is 36 will get them straight to the answer. However, if that method doesn't work for a given problem, then they should use the next method.\n\n**Guessing and skip counting:** Suppose your child is asked to divide 29 by 4. Your child will not find 29 among their multiplication facts involving 4, so they will want to find a result that is less than 29 that does work. Have your child guess at a multiple of 4 that is less than 29. They might guess 24, which is 4 times 6. They can then skip count forward until they bump into 29. In this case that will mean moving forward to 28, which is 4 times 7. Seeing that they have to stop there, they have their answer that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n\n**Checking the answer:** Checking their answers is a good habit for your child to develop. In this last example, we think we found that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1. Check this by multiplying 4 times 7 to get 28, and then adding 1 to get 29. So it all checks out!": "**你已經預備了道路:** 跳過計數、學習乘法錶和事實係列將為有餘數和無餘數的除法鋪平道路。在開始一般的個位數除法之前，應該掌握和理解所有這些技能。\n\n**無餘數:** 除數為整數且無餘數的除法題大多由您的孩子通過識別相應的乘法事實來完成。例如，如果要求他們將 36 除以 4，那麼記住 4 乘以 9 等於 36 就能直接得到答案。但是，如果該方法對給定問題不起作用，那麼他們應該使用下一種方法。\n\n**猜測和跳過計數:** 假設您的孩子被要求用 29 除以 4。您的孩子在涉及 4 的乘法運算中找不到 29，因此他們希望找到一個小於 29 的可行結果。讓您的孩子猜一個小於 29 的 4 的倍數。他們可能會猜 24，即 4 乘以 6。然後他們可以跳過計數，直到碰到 29。在這種情況下，這意味著前進到 28，即 4 乘以 7。看到他們必須停在那裏，他們得出的答案是 29 除以 4 等於 7，餘數為 1。\n\n**檢查答案:** 檢查答案是讓孩子養成的好習慣。在最後一個例子中，我們認為我們發現 29 除以 4 等於 7，餘數為 1。通過將 4 乘以 7 得到 28，然後加 1 得到 29 來檢查這一點。所以一切都正確！",

  "First and foremost, playing math games should be fun, like any other game your family plays together!\n\nPlease let your child make poor plays (mistakes) without correction, and resist the urge to tell them the best ways to play. Bit by bit, your child will get better at the game, and they will learn so much more if you let them figure things out. There is no hurry.\n\nIf you see your child make a mistake, ask them to describe why they decided to do what they did. If your child is stuck and doesn't know which play to make, ask them to describe the pros and cons of their choices, or ask them about how they solved a similar situation in the past. If your child doesn't remember how to do a calculation, discuss with them the methods they know for figuring it out. These conversations are important for helping your child to develop mathematically. \n\nThrough math game play and math conversations, you are helping your child learn to enjoy math and develop important problem solving skills!": "首先，數學遊戲應該要和家人共玩的其他遊戲一樣有趣！\n\n請允許孩子在遊戲中犯錯，不要急著糾正，也請忍住指導他們「最佳玩法」的衝動。讓孩子慢慢摸索，他們會逐漸進步，而這樣的自主探索過程將讓他們學到更多。這完全不需要趕時間。\n\n當您發現孩子出錯時，請先問問他們為什麼會這樣決定；當孩子卡關時，請引導他們分析各個選項的優缺點，或是回憶過去如何解決類似情況；若孩子忘記計算方法，就和他們討論已知的解題策略。這些對話對培養孩子的數學思維至關重要。\n\n透過數學遊戲與數學對話，您正在幫助孩子享受數學，並培養關鍵的問題解決能力！",
  "Puzzles are meant to be challenging and to take time, so please don't ruin the fun by telling your child how to do them. These puzzles are chosen so that you can create them easily and then have fun solving them together.\n\nIf your child gets stuck on a puzzle, you have several options. You can, of course, give very small hints, if you can think of things that won't give away the puzzle. You can suggest looking at smaller or simpler versions of the puzzle. Encourage your child to be bold in their ideas, even if sometimes they lead to dead ends. We all learn a lot from our mistakes and dead ends! Let your child know that it is perfectly okay not to solve a puzzle on the first (or second or third) try, and that useful ideas may occur to them if they leave the puzzle alone for a day or two.\n\nThese puzzles are meant to be fun and to teach problem solving. One of the greatest mathematical pleasures is that AHA moment, after many false starts and much wrestling with a problem, when the answer is finally discovered – be sure to let your child experience that feeling of discovery as many times as you can!": "益智謎題的本質就在於挑戰性與需要時間思考，請不要直接告訴孩子解答，這樣反而剝奪了遊戲的樂趣。這些精心挑選的遊戲設計，讓您能輕鬆準備，並與孩子一同享受解謎的過程。\n\n當孩子遇到困難時，您可以選擇給予一些小小的提示，只要這些提示不會直接揭曉答案。也可以建議孩子先從更簡單或規模較小的版本開始嘗試。鼓勵孩子勇敢嘗試各種想法，即使這些想法最後可能行不通也沒關係。要知道，我們往往能從錯誤和失敗中學到最多！請讓孩子明白，第一次、第二次甚至第三次解不出來都是很正常的，有時候把問題先放著一兩天，反而會突然靈光一現想到好方法。\n\n這些益智謎題的目的不僅是帶來樂趣，更是要培養解決問題的能力。數學最令人著迷的，就是經歷多次嘗試與反覆思考後，突然靈光乍現領悟答案的那種「頓悟時刻」——請務必讓孩子多多體驗這種發現的喜悅與成就感！",
  "Investigations are meant for your child to play with and think about. Let your child explore these looking for interesting patterns and beautiful relationships. Resist the temptation to unveil what is going on and give the answer. If your child seems to have reached a dead end, suggest that they come back to the investigation at a future time to play with it again.\n\nMany investigations benefit from organizing results, and this is a great thing for you to help your child with. Help them make tables, drawings, or whatever may help them see more easily what is going on. And of course, it is perfectly fine to give them gentle nudges from time to time in the right direction. Remember that your child will learn a lot by developing persistence and learning how to look more deeply at things.": "这些探索活動的設計初衷，是讓孩子能夠在遊戲中思考。請讓孩子自由探索，尋找其中有趣的規律與美妙的關聯。請克制住直接揭示答案的衝動。如果孩子似乎陷入了困境，不妨建議他們過段時間再來重新探索。\n\n許多探索活動都能透過整理結果而獲得更多發現，這正是您可以協助孩子的地方。幫助他們製作表格、繪圖，或任何能讓他們更清晰理解當前狀況的方式。當然，適時給予溫和的引導也是很好的。要記住，透過培養堅持力和學會深入觀察，孩子將從中獲得豐富的學習經驗。",

For example, \"Where is the ball?\" If your child can't find the thing, point to it for them.": "在你的孩子學會說話以及了解文字之前先與他們聊一聊。指向、說出名稱和描述你所看到的事物，例如形狀、顏色、比較和數量。當你的孩子開始理解單詞時，對你的孩子說出一個名詞並且讓你的孩子指向和那個名詞對應的事物。例如，「球在哪裡？」如果你的孩子找不到那一樣東西，請指給他們看。",
  "Early Talking": "初期對話",
  "As your child begins to understand and say words, mix in simple questions. Freely help with answers as needed. If you point and say \"Is this red?\" and they don't know, supply the answer. If you say \"Count the blocks.\" and your child does not know how, point and count the blocks with them \"one, two, three.\"": "當你的孩子開始理解和說單詞時，融入一些簡單的問題。根據需要給予幫助。當你指著一個事物說 「這是紅色的嗎？」如果他們不知道，就為他們提供答案。當你說 「我們來數一數積木，」如果你的孩子不知道如何數數，帶著他們一邊拿著積木一邊數「一、二、三。」",
  "3 Levels of Discussion": "3個討論級別",
  "Pick an appropriate level for your child. Allow time for thought when asking questions or making comments. Help with the answer when your child stumbles, and follow up correct answers with questions or comments that are small expansions on the child's answer. \n\n**Level 1** Ask simple direct questions. Ask and point at what you see on the page. Where is the toy? What are they doing? What is its name? What color is it? How many balls are there? \n**Level 2** Ask general or open questions about this point in the story. What do you see happening here? What is this group of things? \n**Level 3** Ask about the story line. What has happened? What will happen next? Have you had experiences or seen things similar to this? How does she feel when this happens?": "為你的孩子選擇一個合適他們程度的級別。讓你的孩子有充足的思考和提出發問的時間。在你的孩子解答問題產生困難的時候給予適當的協助，並在正確答案解出以後再加上簡單的問題或評論，這些問題或評論將會成為答案的小幅延伸。\n\n提出簡單直接的問題。對於你在頁面上看到的內容向你的孩子提出問題。玩具在哪裡？它們在做什麼？玩具的名字是什麼？它是什麼顏色？那裏有多少球？\n就故事中的某一點提出一般性或開放性問題。你看到這裡發生了什麼？這組東西是什麼？ \n詢問故事情節。剛才發生了什麼事？接下來會發生什麼？你有過類似的經歷或者目睹過如此的事情嗎？當這種情況發生時，她會有什麼樣的感受？",

For the second reading, read the blue questions and comments. \n3. For the third reading, read the green questions and comments. \n\nAfter that, follow your child's interests and let your discussions go in fun directions.": "這裡提供的問題和評論只是一個開始。\n\n第一次閱讀，請看塗紅色的問題和評論。\n第二次閱讀，請看塗藍色的問題和評論。\n第三次閱讀，請看塗綠色的問題和評論。\n\n之後，跟隨著孩子的興趣，讓你們的討論朝著有趣的方向發展。",
