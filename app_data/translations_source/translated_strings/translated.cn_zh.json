The idea of even and odd numbers now makes a lot more sense to them.\n\nExtend activities from earlier stages to these larger numbers: Stage 3: Shape Sums, Going Up Some More; Stage 4: War - Double Digit Add and Subtract, DiffTriangles and SumTriangles, Fix It, Island Hopping by 1’s and 10’s, Fill in the Blanks Comparison, Sum Square, and Addition Pyramid.",

This fact will also provide many opportunities for fun games and puzzles involving multiplication and factoring.\n* Factoring – Your child will learn the beauty of how numbers break apart into factors. 1 is a unit. A number bigger than 1 only divisible by 1 and itself is prime. A number bigger than 1 that is not prime is composite. 3 **squared** is 3 × 3. 3 **cubed** is 3 × 3 × 3. And 3 raised to a power means to multiply 3 by itself that many times - for example, 3 to the fourth is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.\n* Factors, Divisors, and Multiples – 3 divides evenly into 12. That makes 3 a factor or divisor of 12, and 12 a multiple of 3. 3 is a common factor of 12 and 15, and 12 is a common multiple of 4 and 6.\n* Single-digit Division – Your child will learn division indirectly in the form of finding a missing factor in a multiplication problem.\n* Fact Families for Multiplication and Division – We'll reinforce the connection between these two operations. For example, 2 × 5 = 10, 5 × 2 = 10, 10 / 2 = 5, and 10 / 5 = 2 form a fact family.",

Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can then move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it. A player’s piece cannot double up with another of the same player’s pieces.\n\n**How to win:** You win by taking all your opponent’s pieces.",

However, it is also a great example of two problem solving techniques that you can show to your child when they are ready: 1) learning from simpler examples, and 2) looking for patterns.\n\nAny of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position. Continuing in this way, build up a table of results:\n\n1W - 2W - 3L - 4W - 5W - 6L - 7W - 8W - 9L - 10W",
    "text": "这款游戏无需进行任何分析，它本身就很有趣，而且您的孩子可以通过该游戏来练习1和2的加减法。除此之外，当您的孩子准备好时您可以通过这个例子展示两个解决问题的好技巧：1）从更简单的示例中学习， 2）寻找规律。\n\n该游戏的任何版本都可以通过这种方式进行学习。让我们看一个例子：从10开始做减法，得到0的人获得胜利。这个游戏的难点是10离0太远了。所以，让我们看一个更简单的版本。当要求孩子这样做时，他们通常建议从5或6开始（从1开始似乎是荒谬的，但这实际上是他们应该做的！）通常最好是尽可能从简单的开始（这意味着从1开始）。如果这是您先走并且计数为1，那么通过减1您就可以获胜。再试试别的数字。如果计数为2，您可以通过减2获胜。如果计数为3，那么您必输无疑，无论是减去1还是2，您都将对手置于必胜之地。如果计数为4，您将获胜。因为您将减去1，并将对手置于必败之地。以此类推，我们可以建立如下表格：\n\n1赢 - 2赢 - 3输 - 4赢 - 5赢 - 6输 - 7赢 - 8赢 - 9输 - 10赢",

What is satisfying about this is that, once you decide to look at simpler versions of the problem, the analysis is quick and easy - no tricky analysis needed. Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n\nBut wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1.",

Similarly, for a circle with 9 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, but 3 strings are needed for 3 and 6?

Despite that simple goal, you may start to wonder about deeper ideas in the puzzle.\n\nA frequent theme of problem solving is to learn from simpler problems or examples. So, let’s do that.\n\nThe smallest example is 2 by 2. For this size, it is clear that the rows will end up being either 1 2; 3 0 or 1 3; 2 0.\n\nThe next smallest is 2 by 3. Start this by getting the 1 and 4 in the left column. Once this is done, your puzzle will look like 1 _ _; 4 _ _ . Finish off the last four squares as you would the 2 by 2 case.\n\nThe 2 by 4 puzzle is done similarly. Start by putting 1 and 5 in the left column. Next, put the 2 and 6 in the second left column without disturbing the 1 and 4. Finally finish off the last 2 by 2.\n\nAt this point, the pattern for attacking puzzles with 2 rows is clear. What to do with more than 2 rows? Suppose you have 3 rows. Start the solution by getting the top row correctly laid out. After that, leave the top row undisturbed and use your ability to solve a puzzle with 2 rows.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 4 rows, do the top row first, the second row next (without disturbing the top row), and finish off the last 2 rows as before.",

    "SourceText": "Okay, you have a simple method for solving the puzzle. The next question is: How can I just look at the puzzle and know whether it is solvable or not?\n\nTo make describing the answer as simple as possible, do a few quick moves, if needed, to place the empty square in the bottom row. Next, make a list of the rows in one long list - the first row is listed first, the second row is listed second, and so on with the last row listed last. Omit the empty square when you list the last row.\n\nTake this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n\nAs an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n\nWhy does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions.",
    "text": "很好，您现在已经掌握了一种简单的方法来解决拼图。那么下一个问题来了：我怎样才能看一下拼图就知道它是否可以解决呢？\n\n为了使答案的描述尽可能简单，如有必要，请快速执行一些操作，以将空白正方形放在底行中。接下来，在长列表中列出行的列表——第一行列在第一位，第二行列在第二行，依此类推，最后一行列在最后。当您列出最后一行时，请忽略空的正方形。\n\n拿这个长长的清单，计算其中的反转次数。当列表中较早的数字大于列表中较晚的数字时，这称为取反。如果求反数是偶数，那么这个游戏就可以解决。如果是奇数，则不是。\n\n以本讨论开始时的3 x 3拼图为例。首先将4移至第二行。然后，列表为：6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7。此列表中有10对数字是顺序颠倒的：6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, 和5 3。因为颠倒数字的对数是偶数，所以这个游戏是可以解决的。\n\n为什么该规则有效？我不会在这里进行详细的推论。关键思想是每次移动时都要留意颠倒数字的对数。事实证明，如果您把空格放到最后一行中，那么在进行任何一步移动之后，颠倒数字的对数始终以偶数变化。因此，如果颠倒数字的对数是奇数，那么这个拼图永远不可能按顺序排列。",

Use the Number Shapes activity to represent even numbers and odd numbers with two rows of tokens - when will adding these numbers come out to two equal rows?\n\nOnce this rule is discovered, your child may realize that the particular numbers do not matter so much.

Then 1 would happen 10 / 18 of the time and 2 would happen 8 / 18 of the time. If you put both tokens on 1, you would need to get a 1 and then a 1 to win after two rolls. However, if you put a token on 1 and a token on 2, you would be successful after two rolls with a 1 and then a 2, or a 2 and then a 1 - something that is about 60% more likely to happen!\n\nRather than go into a long, detailed analysis, let’s just leave it at something fairly simple that appeals to our intuition - put most of your tokens on 1, the second most on 2, and maybe one on 0 or 3. There’s no guarantee you’ll win, but you should do pretty well in the long run!",

The challenge is to find a path that connects all the islands with the same answer. It is only legal to connect two islands if their problem’s numbers differ by 1. Only some of the islands will be on the path.\n\nMake these puzzles by starting with about ten islands with some connections. Identify a path from one edge of the islands to the other.

This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n\nAnother thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values.

For example, 32 petals is four 7’s and one 4, and it is also eight 4’s.\n\nBy trying many pairs of numbers, there are lots of examples to play with. For some pairs of numbers there comes a point where all numbers of petals are possible, and for other pairs of numbers there is no such point. For 4 and 7, every number from 18 on is possible.

If your child wants to go up some steps, a natural question is: How many ways can this be done?\nFor example, for 0 steps there is just one way - you just stand there. For 1 step there is one way - you take a single step. For two steps, you can either take one double step or two single steps. \n\nYour child should carefully count many cases of this and make a table of the results. When there is lots of information, a table often helps organize the information and allow patterns to stand out. The table would look like this (okay, going beyond 6 may require too much patience, but here are the numbers):\n\n1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 21 - 34 - 55\n\nAfter looking at these numbers, your child may notice that each pair of consecutive numbers adds up to the next number. Why does this happen? These numbers are called Fibonacci Numbers. The rule for creating the official Fibonacci Numbers is that each number is the sum of the previous two. This also happens for the steps. Hmmm ...\n\nLet’s look closely at one example - say 5 steps. The 8 possibilities are: 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 2+2+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+2+2, and 2+1+2. The first 5 possibilities use 1 for the last move, and the last 3 possibilities use 2 for the last move. That explains it - you can go up 5 steps by either going up 4 steps and taking 1 more step, or by going up 3 steps and going up 2 more steps. The number of ways of going up 5 steps is exactly equal to the sum of the number of ways of going up 4 steps plus the number of ways of going up 3 steps.\n\nPatterns are often understood by patiently going through examples, organizing the data, looking closely at the data, and digging for explanations of why things happen the way they do. This is a good habit to develop in your child.",

The scale is usually supplied with a set of weights that are used to measure the weight of other objects. There are many interesting investigations you can do if you restrict the weights you are allowed to use.\n\n**One Kind of Weight** Suppose you have lots of weights, but they are all the same - say, 5 units. Then the only things you can weigh exactly are objects that are a multiple of 5 (just like skip counting by 5).\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - One Side** Suppose you have lots of weights that are either 4 units or 7 units and you only use them on one side of the balance. The things you can weigh are the same numbers you found in the flower petal investigation. For 4 and 7, starting at 18 units you can weigh everything exactly. If the weights are 4 units and 6 units, you can only weigh even numbers starting with 4.\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - Both Sides** After doing the investigation with two kinds of weights on one side, your child might be surprised if you ask them to weigh a 3-unit item, or even a 1-unit item, with 4’s and 7’s. The trick is to put some weights on one side and other weights on the other side. For example, verify an item weighs 3 units by putting it with a 4-unit weight and see that it balances with a 7-unit weight. Similarly, verify an item weighs 1 unit by putting it with a 7-unit weight and see that it balances with two 4-unit weights.\n\nThere is an important math theorem called Bezout’s Theorem hidden in this investigation. Your child doesn’t need to know about that theorem at this point, but isn’t it cool that a young child can be playing around with advanced mathematics!\n\n**Doubling Weights** What happens if you have one weight each for each of the weights in the doubling progression 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16? How many ways can you weigh something that weighs 13? What is the largest weight you can measure? \n\nAfter some investigation, you will find that you can weigh everything up to one less than double the highest weight - in this case that is 31. Also, each item you can weigh can only be weighed in one way - for example, 13 = 1 + 4 + 8, and there is no other way to do it. Pretty cool! This situation is related to the binary number system.\n\nFibonacci Weights: What happens if the weights are in the Fibonacci Numbers? Is there more than one way to weigh some weights? Find a restriction that would cause there to be only one way for each weight.\n\nSuppose you have one each for the weights 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13. With this, 10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 + 8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 1 + 8. What is causing the duplication is that the Fibonacci rule creates more than one way to write the Fibonacci numbers in terms of themselves - for example, 2 = 1 + 1 and 8 = 5 + 3. The way to fix this problem is to insist that you cannot use two Fibonacci numbers that are neighbors of each other in the sequence. When you add that restriction, the only way to get 10 is 2 + 8.",
    "text": "平衡秤是一种简单的设备，用于判断两个物体的重量是否完全相同。平衡秤通常配备一组重量，用于测量其他物体的重量。如果限制使用的重量种类，有许多有趣的研究可以进行。\n\n一种重量的情况： 假设你有很多重量，但它们都是相同的——比如说5单位。那么，你只能准确称量重量是5的倍数的物体（就像按5的倍数跳数一样）。\n\n两种重量 - 一侧： 假设你有很多重量，重量要么是4单位，要么是7单位，并且你只在平衡秤的一侧使用这些重量。你可以称量的物体重量与在花瓣调查中找到的数字相同。对于4和7，从18单位开始，你可以准确称量所有重量。如果重量是4单位和6单位，你只能称量从4开始的偶数。\n\n两种重量 - 两侧： 在用两种重量在平衡秤的一侧进行调查之后，如果你让孩子用4单位和7单位的重量来称量3单位或1单位的物品，他们可能会感到惊讶。诀窍是将一些重量放在一侧，其他重量放在另一侧。例如，可以通过将3单位物品与一个4单位的重量一起放置，并看到它与一个7单位的重量平衡，从而验证物品的重量是3单位。类似地，可以通过将1单位物品与一个7单位的重量一起放置，并看到它与两个4单位的重量平衡，从而验证物品的重量是1单位。\n\n这个调查隐藏了一个重要的数学定理，叫做贝祖定理（Bezout’s Theorem）。你的孩子目前不需要了解这个定理，但能用这种方式玩转高级数学是非常有趣的！\n\n加倍重量： 如果你有一个每个加倍进程的重量（1, 2, 4, 8, 16），会发生什么？如何称量一个13单位的物品？你能测量的最大重量是多少？\n\n经过一些调查，你会发现你可以称量所有重量，直到最大重量的两倍减去1——在这个例子中是31。同时，你可以称量的每个物品只能用一种方式称量。例如，13 = 1 + 4 + 8，没有其他方法。这非常酷！这种情况与二进制数字系统相关。\n\n斐波那契重量： 如果重量是斐波那契数会发生什么？是否有多种方法来称量某些重量？找出一个限制，使得每个重量只有一种称量方式。\n\n假设你有1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13这些斐波那契数的重量。用这些重量，10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 + 8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 1 + 8。造成重复的原因是斐波那契规则使得斐波那契数可以以不同的方式表示自己——例如，2 = 1 + 1 和 8 = 5 + 3。解决这个问题的方法是坚持不使用序列中相邻的两个斐波那契数。当你加上这个限制时，得到10的唯一方法是2 + 8。",

If it is your turn and you are faced with each of these numbers, here is what will happen: 1 - lose, 2 - win, 3 - lose, 4 - win, 5 - lose, 6 - win, 7 lose, and 8 win. By now the pattern is clear - if it is your move and you have an odd number, then you will lose; if you have an even number, then you will win.\n\nFinding the winning strategy is a big step, but let’s go deeper. Why does this work? What are the properties of odd and even numbers that create this situation? Set this question before your child and give them a lot of time to think about it and experiment with it - there is no hurry, and this process of wrestling with a question is invaluable and should not be short circuited.\n\nSome experimentation with small numbers quickly reveals what is going on. If you have an odd number, all of the divisors are odd, so when you subtract any divisor the result is an even number. Consequently, odd numbers on one turn always lead to an even number on the next turn. Even numbers always have both odd and even numbers for divisors. So, the situation is not quite the same. However, if you have an even number, your goal is to give your opponent an odd number, and there is an easy way to do that - select the divisor 1 and subtract it!",

    "SourceText": "This simple process reveals some interesting facts about primes. See if your child can come up with some of these questions - however, if they don’t arise naturally, here are some questions to ask.\n\na) Why are the numbers that drop down primes?\n\nSuppose you have a composite number. We want to show that this number will have an X under it. Being composite, it is divisible by some number, n, between 1 and that number. If n is a prime, then our composite number would have an X under it from n being an earlier prime. If n is not a prime, then it has an X under it from some earlier prime, call it p. Now, p evenly divides n and n evenly divides our new number, so p must divide our new number. Consequently, when marking the multiples of p, an X would have been placed under our new number.\n\nb) When you are placing X’s for the multiples of a prime, there are some numbers that already have an X from an earlier prime. When does that happen and when doesn’t it happen?\n\nLet’s look at the multiples of 5 in the sieve above. The multiples 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are already crossed out. Only 5 x 5 is new. This happens because 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are all multiples of 2 and 3, earlier primes. If we want to put X’s in fresh places, we must multiply 5 by numbers that only have prime factors that are 5 and above. Because it is a little tedious to keep track of all that, what some people do is only cross out odd multiples and leave it at that.\n\nc) For this sieve, what was the last prime that had a useful new X in its row?\n\nIn this sieve, the primes with useful X’s are 2, 3, and 5. The multiples of 7 and 11 were all old X’s. If you look at the answer to the last question, you will see the answer here. The only way to get new X’s is to multiply a prime by primes bigger than or equal to itself. Once we reach a prime like 7 where 7 x 7 > 25, we do not need to check it. So, we only need to check primes whose square is smaller than or equal to the last number.\n\nd) If you were given a number, say 53, which primes would you need to divide it by to see that it is prime? \n\nFrom the answer to the last question, we only need to check primes whose square is less than or equal to 53. Those primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7 – none of these divides 53 evenly, so 53 must be prime!",
    "text": "这个简单的过程揭示了一些有关质数的有趣事实。看看你的孩子是否能提出一些这些问题——不过，如果它们没有自然出现，以下是一些可以问的问题：\n\n1）为什么下拉的数字是质数？\n\n假设你有一个合成数。我们想要证明这个数字下面会有一个X。作为合成数，它可以被某个在1到该数字之间的数字n整除。如果n是质数，那么我们的合成数会有一个来自n的早期质数的X。如果n不是质数，那么它有一个来自某个早期质数的X，称之为p。现在，p可以整除n，而n可以整除我们的新数字，所以p必须能整除我们的新数字。因此，在标记p的倍数时，会在我们的新数字下放一个X。\n\n2）当你为质数的倍数放X时，有些数字已经有X是来自早期质数的。当这种情况发生时，何时不会发生？\n\n让我们来看一下上述筛选法中的5的倍数。倍数5 x 2、5 x 3和5 x 4已经被标记。只有5 x 5是新的。这是因为5 x 2、5 x 3和5 x 4都是2和3的倍数，2和3是早期质数。如果我们想要在新的位置放X，我们必须将5与只包含5及以上质数的数字相乘。因为跟踪所有这些有点繁琐，有些人只标记奇数倍数，其他的则保持不变。\n\n3）对于这个筛选法，最后一个在其行中产生有用新X的质数是什么？\n\n在这个筛选法中，产生有用X的质数是2、3和5。7和11的倍数都是旧的X。如果你查看上一个问题的答案，你会发现这里的答案。得到新的X的唯一方法是将一个质数与大于或等于它自身的质数相乘。一旦我们到达一个质数，例如7，其中7 x 7 > 25，我们就不需要再检查它。因此，我们只需要检查其平方小于或等于最后一个数字的质数。\n\n4）如果给定一个数字，例如53，你需要用哪些质数来判断它是否是质数？\n\n根据上一个问题的答案，我们只需要检查平方小于或等于53的质数。这些质数是2、3、5和7——这些质数都不能整除53，因此53必须是质数！",

As you will see, this problem involves some sophisticated ideas for a young person. As needed, ask a question or two to give their thinking a little more structure. You know what’s coming – look at simpler tables first to look for patterns - when this idea becomes automatic for your child, this will serve them well for the rest of their lives!\n\nThe simplest tables are 1 by n, and they are easy to understand. Playing with a few values of n, the pattern emerges quickly. It is easy to undervalue a simple result like this; however, any completely understood result is to be celebrated, and this result will lead to others.\n\n**Result** 1 by n table: The ball will take n-1 bounces. The ball will end up in the bottom right corner if n is even and in the upper right corner if n is odd.\n\nThe next simplest tables are 2 by n. The patterns here are a little more involved. Good record keeping can make a big difference in something like this. An observant experimenter will notice that a 2 by 4 table behaves just like a 1 by 2 table, and a 2 by 6 table just like a 1 by 3. This quickly generalizes to the next result.\n\n**Result** A 2 by 2xn table behaves just like a 1 by n table.\n\nWhy is this? What is going on? This is a mathematical process to instill in your child – look for patterns and then seek to understand them, and with that new understanding extend your earlier results.\n\nWhat is going on is that the bounces on a table do not change if you enlarge both dimensions by the same factor. When that is done, the table is bigger but the geometry is the same. In geometry terms, the two tables are said to be “similar.” \n\n**Result** A kxm by kxn table behaves exactly like an m by n table.\n\nWe have gotten here in little steps, but this is a BIG result. It means we can start our analysis on any table by first removing any common factor.\n\nResuming where we left off for 2 by n tables. We understand what happens when n is even, but what happens when n is odd? What happens for 2 by n for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on? The pattern quickly becomes easy to see.\n\n**Result** When n is odd, a 2 by n table has n bounces and ends up in the upper left hand corner.\n\nLots of progress is being made. Playing with more examples leads to some more patterns.\n\n**Result** If n is not a multiple of 3, a 3 by n table has n+1 bounces and ends in the upper right corner if n has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and in the lower right corner if n has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. If n is odd, a 4 by n table has n + 2 bounces and ends in the upper left corner. If n is not a multiple of 5, a 5 by n table has n+3 bounces and ends up in the upper right corner when n is odd and lower right corner when n is even.\n\nAt this point we are tempted to look over the data, see some patterns, and make some conjectures.",

    "text": "3） 假设你只有一个 1 键，并且只能加法或乘以 2。例如，2 × (2 × 1) + 1 是 5。你还可以创造哪些其他数字？\n\n这是一个伪装成二进制数字的问题。对于你的孩子来说，意识到这一点或理解它并不重要，这只是为了玩玩看。任何数字都可以用二进制表示，所以所有数字都可以通过结合乘以 2 和加 1 来实现。例如，21 是 16 + 4 + 1。所以，21 = 2 × (2 × (2 × (2 × 1) + 0) + 1) + 0) + 1。",

Here are some ideas to think about.\n\n**Rule** Always pick a number that is a power of 2 times a number from 1 to 20.\n\nIf you pick a number such as 23 or 46, they can never be hit and you are guaranteed to lose.\n\n**Rule** Never pick a number that is twice another number you could have picked but didn’t.\n\nIf you pick 44, why not pick 22 instead? If the other person picks 22, you will miss a round.\n\n**Further analysis** The numbers from 1 to 20 are equally likely to be picked. However, because 9 leads to 18, 18 is twice as likely as a starting point than say 11 is. If you combine the ways to get different starts, the starting points have the following probabilities:\n\n11 - 1/20 (from 11)\n12 - 3/20 (from 3, 6, and 12)\n13 - 1/20 (from 13)\n14 - 2/20 (from 7 and 14)\n15 - 1/20 (from 15)\n16 - 5/20 (from 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16)\n17 - 1/20 (from 17)\n18 - 2/20 (from 9 and 18)\n19 - 1/20 (from 19)\n20 - 3/20 (from 5, 10, and 20)\n\nClearly the best numbers to use are multiples of 16, 12, and 20. A simple strategy is to use the five numbers: 32, 64, 24, 48, and 40. These numbers will not always win, but they should do very well for you over time.",

A child will put together the patterns from their experiences as they are developmentally ready. For example, you can't teach your child to count to 5 by explaining it to them – you can only expose them to your counting over and over again until it starts making sense to them. Never be impatient or push them to understand it more quickly – they have a lot to learn and they will naturally want to make sense of it all.\n\n**Searching game:** Make a game of searching for objects around where you are.

Counting is also easy to verbalize in front of your child. There are several things to work on at the same time, so it can be more complicated for your child than what you might think.\n\n* Counting forward and backward, including 0 sometimes \n* Learning the numbers\n* Learning quantities\n\n**Repeating the sequence:** At first, all your counting in front of your child will lead to your child starting to repeat the numbers in sequence. Don't be surprised if they leave out some of the numbers or they say the numbers in the wrong order. If they make these errors, don't make a big deal out of it; simply say the count correctly and move on. This is all part of the process and they will eventually learn the numbers in the correct order.\n\n**Count down sometimes:** Counting down will help your child understand the sequence. This helps keep it from being a meaningless sequence of sounds they make that makes adults happy. You can do this almost any time you would have counted up. For example, if you have three apples you want to remove, count down from three after you take away each apple.\n\n**Include 0 sometimes:** Start your counting at 0 sometimes to help 0 become an accepted number and quantity. You can also count down to 0. Counting down to 0 is great for events that are about to happen, say in ten seconds. You can count down to 0 and then say \"Blastoff\" or something similar.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive to an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things about counting and quantities. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when they count something they do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers they're saying. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally, they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Count everything:** There are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it out loud in front of your child, and be sure to count down sometimes and to include 0 sometimes.",

Your \"Point and Describe\" Math Talk will now become Point, Describe, and Ask. Even before your child can say words, they will start to respond nonverbally to you as they begin to make sense of your words.\n\n**Ask questions:** Use this new level of communication to make it clearer which ideas your child understands. \"Where is the bird?\" or \"Where is the ball? makes it clear if your child knows what a bird or ball is. Similarly, \"Point to the tree.\" or \"Point to a car.\" works for those two concepts.\n\n**Handling mistakes:** Ask all kinds of questions. Ask which of two things is bigger or smaller. Ask where you are walking to. Ask where something belongs. All these questions are opportunities for your child to express their understanding and for you to clear up any misconceptions. If your child points to the wrong thing or picks up the wrong thing, simply point out the right thing and don't try to explain their mistake to them.\n\n**Do this while reading:** Now you can add asking questions to your pointing and describing as you read a story. Point to pictures in the story and ask the same questions you would ask about the things around you.\n\n**Simple riddles:** Play games with your child's new skill and have fun with it. Have fun unraveling puzzles together such as: \"There is something red under something blue. Where is it?\"",

    "SourceText": "**Count everything:** Your child can already count to 5. You are now helping them to solidify that counting and as well as extend it to larger numbers. Count things in front of your child and also count with your child when your child wants to. Counting is the foundation of understanding quantities. It also builds a basis for addition and subtraction.\n\nThere are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it with your child, and be sure to include 0 as a starting point sometimes.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive for an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4,\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when you count something you do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Mistakes:** There are many kinds of mistakes you should expect your child to make as they count. Your child may leave out numbers or they may leave out some of the numbers. Or they may get mixed up in doing 1-1 correspondence with a group of things they are counting. Your child will sort all this out with time. For now, when your child makes a mistake, simply count the things out in front of them correctly and move on to something else.\n\n**Understand the numbers:** Don't be in such a hurry for your child to repeat the numbers 1 to 10 that they have no idea what they are saying. Take time with it and reinforce the connection of each number with its corresponding quantity.\n\n**Reading numbers:** You may of course start introducing reading the numbers whenever you like. However, don't let the reading limit the counting. Learning to read numerals will typically take longer than learning to say the numbers and getting a sense of the quantities.",

    "SourceText": "**It helps with meaning:** Counting down is surprisingly effective at solidifying understanding of the number sequence. Many very young children who have learned to count from 1 to 10 have a difficult time when they first try to count from 10 down to 1. This counting in the opposite order forces them to think in a fresh way about how the numbers are ordered. This will be particularly true when your child starts counting to 100 and they start thinking about what happens as they go from one decade to the next – say between 69 and 70.\n\n**It helps with subtraction:** Counting down is also very helpful with learning to subtract. A child who can count down will very quickly learn how to subtract 1 and 2. It is also helpful if counting down becomes automatic, so they can use their full attention on counting down the three steps when doing 9 subtract 3, for example.\n\n**Use when natural:** There are many times when counting down is the natural thing to do. If there are ten seconds left on a timer, you can count down together with the counter. If you say that something can be done three more times, then you can count down from three together.\n\n**Include 0:** It is usually natural to include 0 when counting down, and this is a good thing to do. If you are counting down the time remaining, when you reach 0 you have 0 seconds left. If you count down how many pieces of food your child can eat, when you reach 0 there will be no food left. It is helpful to make 0 a normal and expected quantity to work with.",

Create many, many experiences that allow your child to touch, feel, and directly experience the sizes of quanti- ties and how they compare.\n\n**Line them up:** One simple way to compare the sizes of two quantities is to line them up in 1-to-1 correspondence next to each other. For example, if you play a card game and you want to see who won, you can line up the cards of the two players and see which line has extra cards.\n\n**Common misunderstanding:** Be aware that a small child may think that two short sticks is the same amount as one long stick. This is perfectly understandable, but it is often not what the adult had in mind.\n\n**Give choices:** Put your child in situations where they can choose between two groups of of the same things they really like. When they pick the bigger group, reinforce it by saying that the chosen group had more than the other group.\n\n**Games:** You may be able to start playing simple card games, such as the game of \"War.\" Use the dots on the cards to allow your child to compare the quantities. Another good game to practice with is \"I'm Thinking of a Number,\" where you have a number line of cards with something hidden under one of the cards.\n\n**Number lines:** Number lines are an excellent visual aid for seeing which numbers are smaller (the ones on the left) and which are larger (the ones on the right). This is a good thing to expose your child to from an early age, but be aware that both the numerals and their being in a line is fairly abstract, so it will be a while before they understand what is going on with this picture that has numbers.",

    "SourceText": "**Surprisingly powerful:** The technique called Counting On is a simple idea that is surprisingly helpful. As your child gets comfortable with seeing a group of objects as a quantity, start doing Counting On in front of them to help them get the idea of it.\n\n**Example:** Suppose your child has one row of 3 cards and another row of 4 cards. They can count all the cards one at a time \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\" and see that there are 7 cards. However, if your child recognizes that there are three cards in one row, they don't need to count those cards. They can start their counting at 3, pointing to the three cards on the first row, and then count the second row \"4, 5, 6, 7.\" Your child is Counting On starting at 3, and that's where the name comes from.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** Being able to Count On saves time and effort. It also signals that your child is getting comfortable seeing the quantity associated with a group of objects and can work with them as a group. This is a big conceptual leap that will be very useful to them in all the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing soon to come.\n\n**Connection with addition:** Beginning addition is strongly linked to counting.

However, the ideas of One More and One Less are early and important steps for adding and subtracting.\n\n**Counting up and down:** One more and one less are strongly connected to the ideas of the next number and previous number when you are counting up and down. Counting practice with count- ing both directions will help make it easy for your child to know which number comes next and which number was the previous one.\n\n**Adding 1 and taking away 1:** Combine these ideas with adding and subtracting by asking ques- tions such as: \"How many pebbles do you have now? If I added 1 more, how many would you have? If I took 1 away so you had 1 less, how many would you have?\" These are very easy and natural questions to fit into everyday conversation, and your child can talk about them without ever considering that they are doing addition and subtraction.\n\nIf you have 3 of something and your child has four of that thing, you can discuss various possibilities. Would you have the same amount if you had one more? Would you have the same amount if your child has one less. Be playful with the idea. If your numbers are 3 and 5, you can talk about getting one more twice, or about one of you getting one more and the other getting one less.\n\n**Extend from 1 to 2:** When your child is ready, extend your child's understanding to what happens when you have two more or two less. There is no hurry to get to this, so please make sure your child first thoroughly understands one more and one less.\n\n**Games:** With this simple bit of arithmetic, you can start playing some games with adding and subtracting.

    "SourceText": "**Adding by counting:** For a long time your child has been doing adding problems by counting. If they were asked to add two things to three things, that was done by counting all five things. As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things. This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Using fingers:** Children of this age will benefit greatly from having manipulatives to use when doing addition. It helps cement their understanding of the numbers in terms of quantities. Of course, the manipulative that is always available to them is their fingers. When doing our example of adding two to three, they can put up two fingers on one hand, three fingers on the other hand, and bring the two hands together. Another way to do it is to raise two fingers on one hand, raise three more fingers on that same hand, and then see a total of five fingers raised.\n\n**Add 0 sometimes:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually for your child.\n\n**Subtracting up to 5:** The ideas behind practicing subtraction are similar to those for addition. If your child is going to subtract three from five, have your chid raise five fingers and then lower three of them. Their familiarity with one less and two less will probably make subtracting one and two very easy.\n\n**Subtract 0 and everything sometimes:** Mix in questions where you subtract 0 sometimes. Also mix in questions where you subtract everything. For example, if you have three bits of food and you eat all of them, how many do you have left?\n\n**Memorizing:** As you ask your child to do various adding and subtracting problems that come along, your child will become more and more familiar with them and will eventually memorize them. While it is desirable to eventually make the recall of these facts automatic and easy for your child, there is no hurry.\n\n**Other math facts:** During this time your child's exposure to adding won't be restricted to those whose sum is 5 or less, and that is fine. For example, your child will probably have learned to add 1 or 2 to all the numbers up to 10. Your child may also have begun to learn the adding twin facts, such as 3 + 3 or 4 + 4.",

If you are asked to subtract 3 things from 9 things, you will probably think of this as taking away or removing 3 of the things. The second model involves difference. The difference between two numbers is the distance between them . If you are asked to subtract 7 from 9, you are likely to do this be finding how far apart they are, what their difference is.\n\nBoth understandings of subtraction are needed and are useful. For mental arithmetic, having a choice of using take away or difference can make a big difference in the ease of the calculation. Additionally, some problems are more naturally understood as take away or difference problems.\n\n**Counting down:** Counting down is a natural way to do take away.

Say \"9\" and have a closed fist to indicate 0. Next, count down \"8, 7, 6\" and raise one finger with each number. Stop at 6, when three fingers have been raised.\n\nOver time, using fingers with small subtraction problems will become less necessary. Your child will start to mentally see the change of 3 in going from 9 to 6, and will no longer need to use fingers – just as they no longer need fingers for subtracting 1 or 2.\n\n**Subtracting 1 to 4:** With practice, your child will build up speed using this approach for subtracting the numbers from 1 to 4. Take your time and make sure everyone enjoys the process.",

Let's use 3 and 13 as an example. If you place 13 things on a flat surface, you can separate them into one group of 10 and one group of 3. This demonstrates both that 3 + 10 is 13, and also that 13 - 10 is 3.\n\n**Numerals:** If your child is ready to use numerals, write down 13 = 10 + 3 and 13 - 10 = 3 as you do the demonstration just described. When we write a two-digit number, such as 13, the place on the left is the tens place and the place on the right is the ones place. Then tens place tells how many tens the number has, and the ones place how many ones it has. For 13, it is made up of 1 ten and 3 ones, so 13 = 10 + 3. As another example, 20 is made up of 2 tens and 0 ones.\n\n**It takes time:** Breaking up a number into tens and ones, particularly symbolically with written numbers, is a big conceptual step and you should expect this to take many demonstrations, many explanations, and lots of time.

The sums are also the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's, so that helps to reinforce these adding facts.\n\n**A foundation for doubling:** Knowing adding twins quickly leads to knowing how to double. Suppose you ask your child to double 3. They know that doubling something means to take two if it. So, doubling 3 means 3 plus 3, which is 6.\n\n**Near twins:** A pair of numbers is a near twin if they are one apart, such as 3 + 4. Once your child knows their adding twins, near twins is an easy next step. Think of 3 + 4 as 3 + 3 + 1, so it is 1 more than 3 + 3. So, 3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7. Alternatively, think of 3 + 4 as (4 - 1) + 3, which is 1 less than 4 + 4. So, 3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7.

When you first introduce the phrase of multiplying by 2, be sure to mix in the use of doubling from time to time to help with the transition. Your child will be getting used to the new words \"multiplying\" and \"times.\"\n\n**Half of something:** When something is doubled, such as 3 doubled is 6, then you can take half of the result and get back the original number. For example, suppose you picture 3 doubled as two rows of 3 things. Then taking half of those two matched rows is to take one of the rows, which is 3 things.\n\n**Equal sharing:** When you talk about taking half of something, you can combine that with the idea of sharing it equally among two people. If two people are to get equal shares, they will each get the same thing and that will be half of the original amount.\n\n**Dividing by 2:** If your child is comfortable with all the concepts so far in this learning step, then they are ready to talk about dividing! You can start talking about dividing something equally, or dividing it in two, or dividing by two. Mix together using all these phrases with your child – it will take time for them to absorb this new vocabulary.

    "SourceText": "**10's:** When your child's counting extends from 20 up to 100, the hard parts are the changes in 10's. Those are the parts to give special support and practice. Once your child knows the sequence of the 10's, it is usually very easy for them to fill in the changes in 1's. For example, they will quickly learn to count \"70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.\"\n\n**Skip count by 10's:** When your child gets stuck counting between 1 and 100, it is usually at a transition in 10's. Typical questions to help your child get unstuck are: \"What comes next after the 60's?\" or \"What comes before the 50's?\" Practice skip counting by 10's to help with this. If your child can produce the 10's from 0 to 100 forward and backward, then they will be ready to answer those questions about which 10's come next or before.\n\n**Use objects:** Make this counting have more meaning by practicing it using a large group of small objects, such as pebbles. Gather together 100 of these objects and put them in a big pile off to the side. As your child counts up from one, pull over one object at a time with each number and include it in the current group of objects. Each time a group of ten objects is formed, put that group together in a special tens area. As the numbers increase, the tens area will have more and more groups of tens. By the time your child is in the 50's, there should be five groups of ten and a small collection of left over ones.\n\nYou can also do this practice in reverse by starting with ten groups of tens and then taking away one at a time as your child counts down from 100.\n\n**Count both directions:** Children often become really good counting quickly and automatically upward from 1 to 100, but then have trouble counting in the opposite direction. Counting from 100 to 1 forces more thought about the 10's transitions and helps with understanding the numbers better in general.\n\n**100 number chart:** Having a ten by ten 100 number chart going from 1 to 100, or from 0 to 99, will help your child see the pattern of the numbers. It will make it particularly clear how the tens place stays the same for ten numbers and the ones place keeps changing.",
    "text": "**10 的:** 当您的孩子从 20 数到 100 时，最难的部分是 10 的变化。这些是需要特别支持和练习的部分。一旦您的孩子知道了 10 的顺序，他们通常很容易填写 1 的变化。例如，他们会很快学会数“70、71、72、73、74、75、76、77、78、79”。\n\n**按 10 跳过计数:** 当您的孩子在 1 到 100 之间数数时遇到困难，通常是在 10 的过渡阶段。帮助您的孩子摆脱困境的典型问题是：“60 之后是什么？”或“50 之前是什么？”练习以 10 为单位跳过计数以帮助解决这个问题。如果您的孩子可以从 0 到 100 正向和反向数出 10，那么他们将准备好回答关于哪些 10 在下一个或之前的问题。\n\n**使用物体:** 通过使用一大堆小物体（如鹅卵石）进行练习，让计数更有意义。收集 100 个这样的物体，将它们堆放在一边。当您的孩子从一开始数数时，每次拉一个带有每个数字的物体，并将其包含在当前的物体组中。每当形成一组十个物体时，就将该组放在一个特殊的十位数区域。随着数字的增加，十位数区域将有越来越多的十位数组。等您的孩子数到 50 时，应该有五组十位数和一小堆剩余的个位数。\n\n您也可以反向练习，从十组十开始，然后随着您的孩子从 100 倒数，一次减去一个。\n\n**计算两个方向:** 孩子们通常能够快速而自如地从 1 数到 100，但反过来数却有困难。从 100 数到 1 会迫使他们更多地思考 10 的过渡，并有助于更好地理解数字。\n\n**100 数字图表:** 拥有一张从 1 到 100 或从 0 到 99 的十乘十 100 数字表，将帮助您的孩子看到数字的规律。它将特别清楚地说明十位数字保持不变，而个位数字不断变化。",

    "SourceText": "**Number meaning:** Seeing a two-digit number as some number of tens and ones is central to understanding and working with those numbers. Doing two-digit addition and subtraction requires fluency with the concepts of place value. Develop that understanding through lots of experiences with physical objects and written numbers.\n\n**Bundles of tens:** Take something you have lots of, make a large pile of it, and put some of them in a few bundles of ten. For example, out of that large pile ask your child to gather 23 of them. Then ask your child to group them in groups of ten. They will form two groups of ten and 3 singles. See what happens with the groups of ten in these 23 things as you put in some additional items or take some away, always making sure that there are no more than 9 single items at any time.\n\n**Expanded form:** The expanded form of a number is writing it as a sum of its place value parts. For example, 23 would be written as 20 + 3, and 256 would be written as 200 + 50 + 6. Practice with your child converting in both directions between a number's usual form and its expanded form. Point out that the expanded form of a number is the same as taking that many things and bundling them into groups of ten and have ones left over.\n\n**Counting with tick marks:** Counting using groups of five tick marks is a natural thing people like to do and is strongly related to place value. If you are counting 23 things with tick marks, you will end up with 4 bundles of 5 and 3 tick marks left over. Those 4 bundles of 5 can be reorganized as 2 bundles of 2 groups of 5, which is our expanded form view of 23.\n\n**Skip counting:** Skip counting by various numbers is a way to build mental practice with adding or subtracting single-digit and double-digit numbers. Although it is a great way to practice, this does require some mental steps that not every child will be ready for at this point – there is no hurry. Here are two examples. With lots of practice, these thinking steps will become automatic.\n\nSkip count upward by 8 starting at 23. Think of 23 as 20 plus 3 more. Using the number bonds for 10, 3 will need 7 more to make a group of 10. Use 7 out of the 8 being added so that 3 plus 7 forms another group of 10. So, 23 + 8 becomes 20 + 10 + 1, which is 31.\n\nSkip count downward by 5 starting at 23. Break up 5 into 3 and 2. To subtract 5, we will first take away 3 and then take away 2. 23 subtract 3 brings us to 20, which we will think of as 10 + 10. Subtracting the remaining 2 from one of those 10's leaves 8, so our answer is 10 + 8, which is 18.",
    "text": "**数字含义:** 将两位数视为十位数和个位数是理解和使用这些数字的关键。进行两位数加减运算需要熟练掌握位值概念。通过大量使用实物和书面数字的经验来培养这种理解。\n\n**成捆的:** 拿出你有很多的东西，堆成一大堆，然后把其中的一些分成几捆，每捆十个。例如，让您的孩子从那一大堆中收集 23 件。然后让您的孩子将它们分成十个一组。它们将形成两组，每组十件，每组三件。看看当你放入一些额外的物品或拿走一些物品时，这 23 件物品中的十个组会发生什么情况，始终确保任何时候的单件物品不超过 9 件。\n\n**展开形式:** 数字的展开形式是将其写为其位值部分的总和。例如，23 可以写为 20 + 3，256 可以写为 200 + 50 + 6。与您的孩子一起练习在数字的正常形式和展开形式之间进行双向转换。指出数字的展开形式与将那么多东西捆成十个一组并剩下个数相同。\n\n**用刻度线计数:** 使用 5 个刻度线组进行计数是人们喜欢做的一件自然的事情，并且与位值密切相关。如果您用刻度线计数 23 个东西，那么您最终会得到 4 捆 5 个东西和 3 个剩余的刻度线。这 4 捆 5 个东西可以重新组织成 2 捆 2 组 5 个东西，这就是我们对 23 的扩展形式视图。\n\n**跳过计数:** 跳过各种数字的计数是一种通过加减一位数和两位数来建立心理练习的方法。虽然这是一种很好的练习方法，但这确实需要一些心理步骤，并不是每个孩子现在都准备好了——不必着急。以下是两个例子。经过大量练习，这些思考步骤将成为自动化的。\n\n从 23 开始，每次向上跳数 8。将 23 视为 20 加上 3。使用 10 的数字键，3 需要再加 7 才能组成 10 组。使用所加 8 中的 7，这样 3 加 7 就形成另一个 10 组。因此，23 + 8 变成 20 + 10 + 1，即 31。\n\n从 23 开始，每次向下跳过 5 个数。将 5 分成 3 和 2。要减去 5，我们首先要减去 3，然后减去 2。23 减去 3 得到 20，我们将其视为 10 + 10。从其中一个 10 中减去剩下的 2 得到 8，所以我们的答案是 10 + 8，也就是 18。",

    "SourceText": "**Useful and easier than you think:** Compensation is a useful mental arithmetic tool for simplifying addition and subtraction calculations of all sizes. Understanding it also increases number sense for addition and subtraction. It is simpler than it sounds.\n\nFor example, suppose you were adding 99 + 15. You would recognize that 99 needs just one more to make 100, a number that is much easier to work with than 99. So you would move 1 from the 15 to the 99 – you would have the same total number of things, but they are distributed in a way that's easier to work with. This problem becomes 100 + 14, which is very easy to do. This is the kind of thing we'll be doing.\n\n**Compensation for addition:** The idea is to give or take some small amount to make one of the numbers easier to work with. We will typically be making one of the numbers into a multiple of 10. Suppose you are adding 8 + 7. The 8 just needs 2 more to become 10, so take that 2 away from the 7. This makes 8 + 7 into 10 + 5, which is easy. We could also have done this problem by giving 3 to the 7 to make it 10. In that case, we'd turn 8 + 7 into 5 + 10.\n\n**More compensation for addition:** There are other possibilities for using compensation in addition problems. Consider 6 + 8 for example. The 6 could give 2 to the 8 to make this problem 4 + 10. However, the 8 could give 1 to the 6 to make this 7 + 7, an adding twins problem. Challenge each other to think of different ways for doing a given adding problem.\n\n**Compensation for subtraction:** For subtraction, we will add the same amount or subtract the same amount from both numbers. This will keep the distance between them the same but will make them easier to work with. Typically that will mean turning the number we're subtracting into a multiple of 10. Suppose we are subtracting 13 - 8. If we add 2 to both numbers, then the distance between stays the same, but now we are subtracting 15 - 10, which is easy. Similarly, if we were asked to do 17 - 13, we could subtract 3 from both numbers and turn it into 14 - 10. Alternatively, we could subtract 10 from both numbers and turn it into 7 - 3.",

The 7 could have been broken up into 5 and 2 – the 5 would be added to the original 5 to get 10, and then the 2 would be added to 10 to get 12.\n\nNotice that this is similar to the thinking for doing addition compensation.\n\n**Subtracting from a number bigger than 10:** Let's use 12 - 7 as our example.

These games have a lot to offer children mathematically, even when there is no explicit numerical content. In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving.\n\n**An introduction to Nim:** Now that your child has been playing strategy games for a while, it is time to look into how to get more out of them. Let's use the game of Nim as an example. This game has some very simple rules: Pick a starting number, say 10, and a person to go first. Players alternate turns choosing to subtract 1 or 2 from the running total. The person who reaches 0 wins. The arithmetic is simple enough, but the strategy is challenging.\n\n**Learning from experience:** If you imagine you are playing any game against an extremely capable opponent, the game becomes a puzzle. How can I find the move that let's me have my best chance of winning no matter how well my opponent plays? One strategy is to play the game many times and pay attention to what seems to work and what doesn't. This approach is a good start and it does provide the opportunity for observation and insights. This can be a slow method of learning, and it may be very hard to find patterns in complicated games – imagine all the possibilities if we picked the starting number of 100 for Nim!\n\n**Solving Nim:** Can we look ahead a few moves and figure out good moves that way? That is hard to do starting at 10. If we start at 5, it's pretty easy to do. If we subtract 2, the new number will be 3. No matter whether the other play subtracts 1 or 2 at this point, we will win. So, if we are at the number 5, we know how to win. What happens with other small starting numbers? Can we find a pattern that will tell us which starting numbers will be winners and which will be losers? Can we explain why that pattern is true?\n\n**The goal:** If we follow this line of attack, we will completely solve how to play the game of Nim. What worked for Nim may or may not work for another game. This is problem solving, and each new problem can bring fresh challenges and a need for new ideas. And that is the fun. Share this attitude of puzzling and being challenged to your child. As they play a strategy game, discuss with them their ideas about what would make for a better or worse move at that moment. The point isn't so much to find the perfect move as it is to enjoy looking for it and having a discussion about it with people who they can enjoy sharing ideas with.",

The difficulty here is that it is not so easy to have hundreds of objects in the first place, and it can also be unwieldy to deal with such a large collection. In addition to having groups of ones and tens of some object, one strategy is to use symbolic place holders for large groups, such as 100s. You could have several pieces of paper or wood on which you have written \"100.\"\n\n**Use objects:** Practice having your child represent various quantities using objects grouped in ones, tens, and hundreds. For example, ask how 325 would be represented using these objects. Include examples such as 206, 430, and 500 that have zero things in one or more categories. Also, lay out collections of ones, tens, and hundreds and ask your child to name the number for this quantity.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Once your child is thoroughly comfortable with the connection between numbers and their quantities, start using numerals and expanded form to represent the numbers. Take a number, such as 325, for example. Represent it with quantities for hundreds, tens, and ones, and then use the quantity representation to write the number in expanded form as 325 = 300 + 20 + 5. Do this same practice in the opposite direction by writing 100 + 40 + 6, representing it with physical groups of hundreds, tens, and ones of objects, and then asking what the total number is.",

    "SourceText": "**Single digit:** A gentle introduction to working with two two-digit numbers is to have one of them be a single-digit number. One of the best ways to practice adding or subtracting a single-digit number with a double-digit number is to do skip counting using various skip sizes, going up or down, and starting at any number. The following methods for two two-digit numbers will of course work when one of the numbers is a single-digit number.\n\n**Use objects:** Grounding your child's understanding by using physical objects is always a good idea. Start by representing both of the numbers with groups of tens and ones.\n\n**Adding:** If you are adding the two numbers, put all the groups together and discuss the result. If you are adding two numbers, such as 23 and 45, that is all you need to do. However, if you are adding 23 and 48, the two groups of ones form at least a group of ten. Talk about how that changes the total number of tens you have from 6 to 7. This is called regrouping.\n\n**Subtracting:** If you are subtracting, start by removing the tens being subtracted from the bigger number and then attempt to remove the appropriate number of ones. For example, if you are subtracting 23 from 45, then there are enough ones and you are done. If there are not enough ones, such as if you are subtracting 28 from 45, then discuss how one of the groups of tens needs to be broken up and included with the ones. The original grouping of 45 as 4 tens and 5 ones becomes a grouping of 3 tens and 15 ones. This is also called regrouping.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Use objects for double-digit adding and subtracting until your child thoroughly understands the process and why regrouping makes sense when it is needed. At this point, move to representing the adding and subtracting with numbers written in expanded form. When working with numbers in expanded form, the process and the steps are exactly the same as they were when you were working with groups of tens and ones – and that is the point.\n\n**Making it automatic:** Over time and with lots of practice, your child will stop needing to use groups of tens and ones or expanded form.

Use 6 times 9 as an example. For the answer, put one less than the number in the tens place (which is 5), and subtract the tens place from 9 to get the ones place (which is 4). So 6 times 9 is 54. As you'll see, this is no different than subtracting 6 from 6 times 10, but somehow it feels like more fun.\n\n**One more and one less:** Use the idea of one more or one less to learn these based on other numbers you now know how to multiply by.

It is far more important that you make this fun and that your child enjoys seeing how the various multiplication facts in- terrelate – which ones are doubles or halves of others, which ones are one more or one less than others, and which ones have interesting patterns with their ones digits.\n\n**Limited and fun flashcards:** Used sparingly and lightheartedly, flash cards, or something similar, can be helpful. If your child has trouble remembering a handful of the multiplication facts, make a list of just those facts so they can be briefly practiced on their own.",

    "SourceText": "**Divisors and factors:** If a number evenly divides into a number, then it is called a divisor of it. For example, 3 is a divisor of 6 because 3 divides into 6 exactly 2 times. 4 is not a divisor by 6 because it goes into it 1 1/2 times. The word factor means the same thing as divisor.\n\n**Common divisors:** In some mathematical situations, particularly with simplifying fractions, it is useful to find numbers that evenly divide two given numbers. Such numbers are called common divisors or common factors. The common divisors of 20 and 8 are 1, 2, and 4. You may enjoy exploring together why all the common divisors for a pair of numbers are divisors of the greatest of the common divisors.\n\n**Multiples:** A multiple of a number is anything that can be produced by multiplying the number by a whole number. For example, some multiples of 6 are 0, 6, 12, and 18. Notice that any multiple of a number has that number as a divisor. For example, each of the multiples of 6 has 6 as a divisor.\n\n**Common multiples:** A number which is a multiple of two given numbers is said to be a common multiple for them. Some common multiples of 6 and 4 are 0, 12, 24, and 36. Notice that all the common multiples are multiples of the least of the positive common multiples. Common multiples will be useful in adding and subtracting fractions.\n\n**Introduce these words:** Slowly introduce these new words to your child as you discuss situations that involve multiplication and division. They are useful words that simplify many discussions once the words are understood.",

    "SourceText": "**Primes:** Primes are central to understanding multiplication and division of whole numbers. As you will see, primes are the building blocks of numbers using multiplication. A prime number is a number larger than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and itself. The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are the first few prime numbers.\n\n**Composites and 1:** There are three kinds of positive whole numbers: 1 (which is called a unit), primes, and composites. Composites can be thought of as being constructed from primes. For example, 12 is 2 times 2 times 3. Every number larger than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely written as a product of two or more primes.\n\n**Prime factorizations:** Getting to know prime factorizations really well will be very helpful for many parts of the math your child is about to learn. Repeating the prime factorizations of the numbers up to 20, or even 30, is a good exercize for getting to know these factorizations. Simply go through the list of numbers in order like this: 1 - unit, 2 - prime, 3 - prime, 4 - 2 times 2, 5 - prime, 6 - 2 times 3, 7 - prime, 8 - 2 times 2 times 2, 9 - 3 times 3, and 10 - 2 times 5.\n\n**Powers:** Prime factorizations often involve repeated prime factors, so this is a good time to learn about powers and to practice them. It is quicker and easier to understand to say \"2 to the fourth\" than it is to say \"2 times 2 times 2 times 2.\" 2 squared means 2 times 2, and 2 cubed means 2 times 2 times 2.",
    "text": "**素数:** 素数对于理解整数的乘法和除法至关重要。如你所见，素数是使用乘法的数字的构成要素。素数是大于 1 的数字，其唯一除数是 1 和它本身。数字 2、3、5、7 和 11 是前几个素数。\n\n**合数和 1:** 正整数有三种：1（称为单位）、质数和合数。合数可以看作是由质数构成的。例如，12 是 2 乘以 2 乘以 3。每个大于 1 的数字要么是质数，要么可以唯一地写成两个或多个质数的乘积。\n\n**质因数分解:** 真正了解质因数分解对您的孩子即将学习的数学的许多部分都非常有帮助。重复对数字进行质因数分解，直到 20 甚至 30，是了解这些因数分解的一个很好的练习。只需按以下顺序浏览数字列表：1 - 单位，2 - 质数，3 - 质数，4 - 2 乘以 2，5 - 质数，6 - 2 乘以 3，7 - 质数，8 - 2 乘以 2 乘以 2，9 - 3 乘以 3，10 - 2 乘以 5。\n\n**幂:** 质因数分解通常涉及重复的质因数，因此这是学习幂并练习幂的好时机。说“2 的四次方”比说“2 乘以 2 乘以 2 乘以 2”更快、更容易理解。2 的平方意味着 2 乘以 2，2 的立方意味着 2 乘以 2 乘以 2。",

Similar to what was done for addition and subtraction, group multiplication and division facts by families to gain a deeper understanding of them. For example, 3 x 4 = 12, 4 x 3 = 12, 12 / 3 = 4, and 12 / 4 = 3 form a fact family.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing are related:** For the 3 x 4 = 12 fact family, visualize this interconnection using a rectangle that is 3 by 4. The area of this rectangle is 12, which is 3 times 4 or 4 times 3 – its width times its length. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of width 3, the length must be 4. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of length 4, its width must be 3. All these facts are tied together.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing undo each other:** Let's continue to use the example of 3 times 4. If we start with 3 and multiply it by 4 we arrive at 12. If we then take 12 and divide it by 4, the result is back to 3. Multiplying by 4 and then dividing by 4 gets back to where we started.\n\nSimilarly, if we take 12 and divide by 4 the answer is 3. If we then multiply 3 by 4 the answer is 12, which is where we started. Dividing by 4 and then multiplying by 4 returns things to the beginning.",
    "text": "**家庭:** 在第 3 阶段，我们探索了连接加法和减法的事实系列，并看到了它们对于理解这两个运算之间的相互联系有多大用处。与对加法和减法所做的类似，将乘法和除法事实按系列分组，以加深对它们的理解。例如，3 x 4 = 12、4 x 3 = 12、12 / 3 = 4 和 12 / 4 = 3 形成一个事实系列。\n\n**乘法和除法是相关的:** 对于 3 x 4 = 12 这一事实系列，使用一个 3 x 4 的矩形来形象化这种相互联系。这个矩形的面积是 12，即 3 乘以 4 或 4 乘以 3（即其宽度乘以长度）。要得到宽度为 3 的矩形的面积为 12，其长度必须为 4。要得到长度为 4 的矩形的面积为 12，其宽度必须为 3。所有这些事实都联系在一起。\n\n**乘法和除法互相抵消:** 我们继续使用 3 乘以 4 的例子。如果我们从 3 开始并将其乘以 4，则结果为 12。如果我们随后将 12 除以 4，结果又回到 3。乘以 4 然后除以 4 又回到我们开始的位置。\n\n类似地，如果我们取 12 并除以 4，答案是 3。如果我们再将 3 乘以 4，答案是 12，也就是我们开始的地方。除以 4 然后乘以 4 会回到开始的地方。",

All those skills should be well mastered and understood before starting in on general single-digit division.\n\n**No remainder:** Division problems where the divisor goes in evenly without a remainder are mostly done by your child recognizing the corresponding multiplication fact. For example, if they are asked to divide 36 by 4, then remembering that 4 times 9 is 36 will get them straight to the answer. However, if that method doesn't work for a given problem, then they should use the next method.\n\n**Guessing and skip counting:** Suppose your child is asked to divide 29 by 4. Your child will not find 29 among their multiplication facts involving 4, so they will want to find a result that is less than 29 that does work. Have your child guess at a multiple of 4 that is less than 29. They might guess 24, which is 4 times 6. They can then skip count forward until they bump into 29. In this case that will mean moving forward to 28, which is 4 times 7. Seeing that they have to stop there, they have their answer that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n\n**Checking the answer:** Checking their answers is a good habit for your child to develop. In this last example, we think we found that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1. Check this by multiplying 4 times 7 to get 28, and then adding 1 to get 29. So it all checks out!",

Remember that your child will learn a lot by developing persistence and learning how to look more deeply at things.",
    "text": "探索是为了让你的孩子能在玩的时候思考。让你的孩子探索这些有趣的规律和美丽的关联。抵制住想要揭开真相并给出答案的欲望。如果你的孩子似乎进入了死胡同，可以建议他们在未来的时间再回来继续玩与探索它。\n\n有条理的探索更有益于学习，这也是你可以参与帮助他们的事情之一。帮助他们制作表格，绘图，或任何可以帮助他们理解正在发生的事情的方法。当然，在正确的方向上时不时地推动他们是完全没问题的。记住，你的孩子会通过培养毅力和学习如何更深入地看待事物，而学到很多东西。",
