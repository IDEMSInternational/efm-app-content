The easiest for you is to simply say the list. If the items are easy to draw, you can draw them. If the items are hard to draw, you may be able to find photos or drawings in ads or magazines that you can cut out and select from. You may be able to use a single photo with lots of content and point out four things in the photo.\n\nFor activities like this, once your child has practiced this for a while and has a solid idea of the activity, it is good to reverse your roles - your child will learn a lot by creating examples for you to solve. As before, their reasoning may be very different from yours, so listen carefully.",

However, it is also a great example of two problem solving techniques that you can show to your child when they are ready: 1) learning from simpler examples, and 2) looking for patterns.\n\nAny of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position.

Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n\nBut wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1.",

Use a set of 15 pieces of paper the size of the grid squares, and number the pieces of paper from 1 to 15. The puzzle starts by having someone place the pieces of paper on the grid. The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty. To achieve this, a piece of paper can be moved if it is adjacent to the empty square - in which case it can be slid into that space. Depending on how the person sets up the puzzle, the puzzle may or may not be solvable.\n\nA 4 x 4 grid is too hard for a beginner, so start with something smaller. The grid could be as small as 2 x 2 or as big as the child wants. The number of numbered pieces of paper will always be one less than the size of the grid. For example, on a 2 x 3 grid use the cards from 1 to 5.",

    "SourceText": "The main reason for a child to play with this puzzle is to have fun moving pieces around until they accidentally solve it and also to practice getting numbers in order. Despite that simple goal, you may start to wonder about deeper ideas in the puzzle.\n\nA frequent theme of problem solving is to learn from simpler problems or examples. So, let’s do that.\n\nThe smallest example is 2 by 2. For this size, it is clear that the rows will end up being either 1 2; 3 0 or 1 3; 2 0.\n\nThe next smallest is 2 by 3. Start this by getting the 1 and 4 in the left column. Once this is done, your puzzle will look like 1 _ _; 4 _ _ . Finish off the last four squares as you would the 2 by 2 case.\n\nThe 2 by 4 puzzle is done similarly. Start by putting 1 and 5 in the left column. Next, put the 2 and 6 in the second left column without disturbing the 1 and 4. Finally finish off the last 2 by 2.\n\nAt this point, the pattern for attacking puzzles with 2 rows is clear. What to do with more than 2 rows? Suppose you have 3 rows. Start the solution by getting the top row correctly laid out. After that, leave the top row undisturbed and use your ability to solve a puzzle with 2 rows.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 4 rows, do the top row first, the second row next (without disturbing the top row), and finish off the last 2 rows as before.",
    "text": "讓孩子玩這個遊戲的一個主要原因是讓他們樂在其中，直到他們不小心解決了問題，並且還可以從中練習按順序排列數字。儘管目標很簡單，但您可能會開始好奇這個的更深層的用意。\n\n解決問題的常見方法是從簡單的問題或示例中學習。所以，讓我們開始吧。\n\n最小的示例是2 x2。對於這種大小，很明顯，行最終要麽是1 2; 3 0，或者是1 3; 2 0\n\n第二小的是2x3。對於這個尺寸，可以先把1和4移到最左側一列中。完成此操作後，您的拼圖將看起來像1 _ _； 4 _ _。完成最後的四個正方形，就像處理2 x 2的情況一樣。\n\n2 x 4拼圖的處理方法與此類似。首先把1和5移到最左側一列中。接下來，將2和6放在左側第二列，而先不要管1和4。最後解決2 x2。\n\n目前為止我們已經清楚了如何解決2行拼圖，那麽超過2行的應該怎麼辦？比如說對於3行的拼圖，您可以通過從正確排列第一行著手。之後，維持第一行現狀，接下來的就和解決兩行拼圖一樣了。\n\n同樣，如果有4行，則先進行第一行，然後進行第二行（不影響第一行），然後再像以前一樣完成最後兩行。",

    "SourceText": "Okay, you have a simple method for solving the puzzle. The next question is: How can I just look at the puzzle and know whether it is solvable or not?\n\nTo make describing the answer as simple as possible, do a few quick moves, if needed, to place the empty square in the bottom row. Next, make a list of the rows in one long list - the first row is listed first, the second row is listed second, and so on with the last row listed last. Omit the empty square when you list the last row.\n\nTake this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n\nAs an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n\nWhy does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions.",
    "text": "很好，您現在已經掌握了一種簡單的方法來解決拼圖。那麽下一個問題來了：我怎樣才能看一下拼圖就知道它是否可以解決呢？\n\n為了使答案的描述盡可能簡單，如有必要，請快速執行一些操作，以將空白正方形放在底行中。接下來，在長列表中列出行的列表——第一行列在第一位，第二行列在第二行，依此類推，最後一行列在最後。當您列出最後一行時，請忽略空的正方形。\n\n拿這個長長的清單，計算其中的反轉次數。當列表中較早的數字大於列表中較晚的數字時，這稱為取反。如果求反數是偶數，那麼這個遊戲就可以解決。如果是奇數，則不是。\n\n以本討論開始時的3 x 3拼圖為例。首先將4移至第二行。然後，列表為：6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7。此列表中有10對數字是順序顛倒的：6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, 和5 3。因為顛倒數字的對數是偶數，所以這個遊戲是可以解決的。\n\n為什麼該規則有效？我不會在這裏進行詳細的推論。關鍵思想是每次移動時都要留意顛倒數字的對數。事實證明，如果您把空格放到最後一行中，那麼在進行任何一步移動之後，顛倒數字的對數始終以偶數變化。因此，如果顛倒數字的對數是奇數，那麽這個拼圖永遠不可能按順序排列。",

For numbers greater than 4, the upper group of 5 squares is always filled.\n* Expanded Form – This refers to writing a multi-digit number broken down into the contribution of each of its digits. For example: 25 = 20 + 5 and 317 = 300 + 10 + 7.\n* Fact Families – This refers to a group of closely related math facts. For example, 2 + 5 = 7 is in the same family as 7 - 2 = 5 and 7 - 5 = 2.\n* Adding twins and near twins – An adding twin is adding a number to itself, such as 4 + 4. A near twin is one away from a twin, such as 4 + 5.\n* Doubling, multiplying by two, and halving, two equal parts, dividing in two – Children usu-\nally enjoy adding twins. With that comes the idea of doubling and multiplying by 2. Also\nassociated with that is halving, splitting something into two equal parts, and dividing by two.\n* Even and Odd numbers – Even numbers can be split into two equal parts. Odd numbers have one left over when split into two equal parts. Even numbers are the results of adding twins.\n* Skip counting by 2’s – Count up or down by 2’s – such as, 0, 2, 4, 6 or 13, 11, 9, 7.",

Put the remaining cards in a common draw pile. Players take turns “fishing” for cards whose number will sum to the target sum with cards they already have.\n\nFor example, a player might ask a player, “Do you have any 4’s?” If that player has some 4’s, they are handed over and the original player gets another turn. However, if that player does not have any 4’s, then the player says “Go Fish!” and a card is drawn from the draw pile.

They can compare two double-digit numbers, and they have a beginning sense of place value with 10’s and 1’s.\n\nAs their skip counting is improving, they are also developing skills with multiplying by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The idea of even and odd numbers now makes a lot more sense to them.\n\nExtend activities from earlier stages to these larger numbers: Stage 3: Shape Sums, Going Up Some More; Stage 4: War - Double Digit Add and Subtract, DiffTriangles and SumTriangles, Fix It, Island Hopping by 1’s and 10’s, Fill in the Blanks Comparison, Sum Square, and Addition Pyramid.",

This fact will also provide many opportunities for fun games and puzzles involving multiplication and factoring.\n* Factoring – Your child will learn the beauty of how numbers break apart into factors. 1 is a unit. A number bigger than 1 only divisible by 1 and itself is prime. A number bigger than 1 that is not prime is composite. 3 **squared** is 3 × 3. 3 **cubed** is 3 × 3 × 3. And 3 raised to a power means to multiply 3 by itself that many times - for example, 3 to the fourth is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.\n* Factors, Divisors, and Multiples – 3 divides evenly into 12. That makes 3 a factor or divisor of 12, and 12 a multiple of 3. 3 is a common factor of 12 and 15, and 12 is a common multiple of 4 and 6.\n* Single-digit Division – Your child will learn division indirectly in the form of finding a missing factor in a multiplication problem.\n* Fact Families for Multiplication and Division – We'll reinforce the connection between these two operations. For example, 2 × 5 = 10, 5 × 2 = 10, 10 / 2 = 5, and 10 / 5 = 2 form a fact family.",
    "text": "* 數到200 – 看看 100 到 200 的數字，來認識一下百位。\n* 跳數到 100 – 這並不是新知識，但這是一個需要加強的重要技能。\n* 展開式和位值 – 這是一項基礎技能，因此需要進一步加強。\n* 兩位數加減法 – 跳數可以幫我們輕鬆進行兩位數的加減。\n* 一位數乘法 – 是時候學習 6、7、8 和 9 乘法了。\n* 矩形面積＝長×寬 – 這個本身就是一個重要的數學概念。這個知識點還能為很多有趣的遊戲和涉及乘法與因式分解的謎題提供訣竅。\n* 因式分解 – 你的孩子將學習數字如何分解成因數的奇妙之處。1 是一個單位。大於 1 且僅能被 1 和自身整除的自然數是質數；大於 1 且不是質數的數是合數。3 的平方是 3 x 3。3 的立方是 3 x 3 x 3。3 的冪是指將 3 乘以自身很多次——例如，3 的四次方是 3 x 3 x 3 x 3。\n* 因數、約數和倍數 – 3 可以整除 12。這使得 3 成為 12 的因數或約數，而 12 是 3 的倍數。3 是 12 和 15 的公因數，而 12 是 4 和 6 的公倍數。\n* 一位數除法 – 你的孩子將透過在乘法問題中找出缺失的因數來間接學習除法。\n* 乘法和除法的運算族 – 我們將在該階段加強這兩種運算之間的聯繫。例如，2 x 5 = 10、5 x 2 = 10、10 ÷ 2 = 5 和 10 ÷ 5 = 2 構成了一個乘除法運算族（一組相關的數學算式，使用相同的數字，但運算不同）。",

Finding a way to exactly cover the chessboard with 32 of these 1 by 2 tiles is simple enough.\n\n**Remove corners:** Let’s start playing with removing squares from the chessboard. If you remove one corner of the chessboard, you know immediately that you can no longer cover the chessboard with tiles because the tiles will cover an even number of squares, and there are now 63 squares. Okay, remove two corners to make an even number of remaining squares – can you cover it now? The answer depends on which two corners you remove. Why? What if you no longer restrict yourself to removing corners, what happens?\n\n**Learn from smaller examples:** One important lesson in dealing with questions like these is to learn from smaller problems.

When picking up clothes or putting them away, talk about why some clothes go in one place and others go in other places.\n\n**Going to sleep and getting up:** These times lend themselves to discussing doing things in order, and practicing words like first, second, third, last, and next.\n\n**Discuss as you read:** Storytime is a wonderful chance to do math with your child in a cozy setting. Talk about the characters and the things in the pictures. If there is a big yellow sun, point to the sun and say: “The sun is round and it is yellow. The wall of this room is also yellow. Point to something round in this room.”\n\nAs your child gets older, count together by pointing, such as the yellow flower petals in a picture, or ask your child to point to things you describe.\n\n**Food:** Whether putting food away, cooking food, or setting things out for mealtime, there are many opportunities for math. Different kinds of food should be put away in particular places – this is a good time for relationship words like inside, under, and over.\n\nCooking involves measuring quantities, talking about lengths of time, and describing the desired result for the food. Setting things out for mealtime involves setting out the appropriate number of things so that each person gets what they need.\n\n**Playing with objects:** Compare objects when constructing things for play or other uses.

When children do mathematics, they use ideas about properties of objects to help them work with those objects, such as in grouping them or finding patterns with them. These skills will also help your child when it comes time to start learn- ing to read.\n\n**Point, describe, and compare:** Wherever you are, get in the habit of pointing at things that catch your or your child's attention, and then describing them. Take the opportunity to compare those things to other things to help the descriptions be more meaningful. Talk about how two things are the same or how they are different.\n\n**It is never too early:** From the earliest ages, your child is learning from everything they see, hear, taste, touch, and experience. Add to those experiences with your Math Talk. They are benefiting from your words before they show any reaction to them. Eventually, they will put together the experiences from your words and start showing you that they understand them.\n\n**Expose, but do not rush:** Don't confuse early exposure with teaching. A child will put together the patterns from their experiences as they are developmentally ready. For example, you can't teach your child to count to 5 by explaining it to them – you can only expose them to your counting over and over again until it starts making sense to them. Never be impatient or push them to understand it more quickly – they have a lot to learn and they will naturally want to make sense of it all.\n\n**Searching game:** Make a game of searching for objects around where you are. Use the game to practice concepts that your child is learning, such as color, size (large, medium, small), weight (heavy, light), quantity, and relationship (inside, on top of, below).\n\nOne of you says to the other that they see something that is round on top of something that is brown.

Counting is also easy to verbalize in front of your child. There are several things to work on at the same time, so it can be more complicated for your child than what you might think.\n\n* Counting forward and backward, including 0 sometimes \n* Learning the numbers\n* Learning quantities\n\n**Repeating the sequence:** At first, all your counting in front of your child will lead to your child starting to repeat the numbers in sequence. Don't be surprised if they leave out some of the numbers or they say the numbers in the wrong order. If they make these errors, don't make a big deal out of it; simply say the count correctly and move on. This is all part of the process and they will eventually learn the numbers in the correct order.\n\n**Count down sometimes:** Counting down will help your child understand the sequence. This helps keep it from being a meaningless sequence of sounds they make that makes adults happy. You can do this almost any time you would have counted up. For example, if you have three apples you want to remove, count down from three after you take away each apple.\n\n**Include 0 sometimes:** Start your counting at 0 sometimes to help 0 become an accepted number and quantity. You can also count down to 0. Counting down to 0 is great for events that are about to happen, say in ten seconds. You can count down to 0 and then say \"Blastoff\" or something similar.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive to an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things about counting and quantities. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when they count something they do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers they're saying. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally, they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Count everything:** There are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it out loud in front of your child, and be sure to count down sometimes and to include 0 sometimes.",
    "text": "**計數、數字和數量:** 大多數人想到早期數學時首先想到的是計數和數字，它們是最容易聯係和理解的。計數也很容易在孩子麵前用語言錶達。由於需要同時進行多項練習，因此對孩子來說，這可能比您想象的要複雜得多。\n\n* 正嚮和反嚮計數，有時包括 0\n* 學習數字\n* 學習數量\n\n**重複這一過程:** 一開始，你在孩子麵前數數會讓孩子開始按順序重複數字。如果他們漏掉了一些數字，或者說出了錯誤的順序，請不要感到驚訝。如果他們犯了這些錯誤，不要太在意；隻要正確地說出數字，然後繼續。這都是過程的一部分，他們最終會以正確的順序學習數字。\n\n**有時倒數:** 倒數可以幫助孩子理解順序。這有助於避免他們發出毫無意義的聲音序列，而這些聲音會讓成年人感到高興。幾乎任何時候你都可以這樣做。例如，如果你有三個蘋果要拿走，那麼在你拿走每個蘋果後，從三開始倒數。\n\n**有時包括 0:** 有時從 0 開始計數，有助於讓 0 成為公認的數字和數量。您也可以倒數到 0。倒數到 0 非常適合即將發生的事件，例如十秒後。您可以倒數到 0，然後說「Blastoff」或類似的話 。\n\n**理解數量:** 對於成年人來說，如果你數一堆東西，比如說四塊鵝卵石，當你數「1、2、3、4」時，你說出的最後一個數字就是你擁有的東西的數量大小，這是完全直觀的。你的孩子正在學習一些關於計數和數量的知識。他們正在對數量産生理解。他們正在學習當他們數東西時，他們會將東西和他們所說的數字一一對應。他們正在學習計數的順序並不重要。最後，他們正在學習「最後一個數字是大小」的規則。成年人認為這些事情是理所當然的，但對於孩子來說，學習這些事情是很重要的。要有耐心，記住不要著急。\n\n**计算一切:** 有太多东西需要数数。数椅子、走一小段距离需要走多少步、食物、排队的人、一群人、桌子周围或房间里的家具、手臂、腿，还有谁知道还有什么。每当你发现自己在心里数着某样东西时，就在孩子面前大声数数，一定要有时倒数，有时包括 0。",

    "SourceText": "**Responding:** Once your child is able to respond to what you say, that will allow you to start asking questions. Your \"Point and Describe\" Math Talk will now become Point, Describe, and Ask. Even before your child can say words, they will start to respond nonverbally to you as they begin to make sense of your words.\n\n**Ask questions:** Use this new level of communication to make it clearer which ideas your child understands. \"Where is the bird?\" or \"Where is the ball? makes it clear if your child knows what a bird or ball is. Similarly, \"Point to the tree.\" or \"Point to a car.\" works for those two concepts.\n\n**Handling mistakes:** Ask all kinds of questions. Ask which of two things is bigger or smaller. Ask where you are walking to. Ask where something belongs. All these questions are opportunities for your child to express their understanding and for you to clear up any misconceptions. If your child points to the wrong thing or picks up the wrong thing, simply point out the right thing and don't try to explain their mistake to them.\n\n**Do this while reading:** Now you can add asking questions to your pointing and describing as you read a story. Point to pictures in the story and ask the same questions you would ask about the things around you.\n\n**Simple riddles:** Play games with your child's new skill and have fun with it. Have fun unraveling puzzles together such as: \"There is something red under something blue. Where is it?\"",

You could ask \"Please bring me something that is red.\" for example. As your child gets better at this, make the requests more complicated by combining more than one property – \"Find a round wooden thing.\"\n\n**Grouping things with a property:** Practice grouping things with the same property.

    "SourceText": "**Count everything:** Your child can already count to 5. You are now helping them to solidify that counting and as well as extend it to larger numbers. Count things in front of your child and also count with your child when your child wants to. Counting is the foundation of understanding quantities. It also builds a basis for addition and subtraction.\n\nThere are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it with your child, and be sure to include 0 as a starting point sometimes.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive for an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4,\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when you count something you do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Mistakes:** There are many kinds of mistakes you should expect your child to make as they count. Your child may leave out numbers or they may leave out some of the numbers. Or they may get mixed up in doing 1-1 correspondence with a group of things they are counting. Your child will sort all this out with time. For now, when your child makes a mistake, simply count the things out in front of them correctly and move on to something else.\n\n**Understand the numbers:** Don't be in such a hurry for your child to repeat the numbers 1 to 10 that they have no idea what they are saying. Take time with it and reinforce the connection of each number with its corresponding quantity.\n\n**Reading numbers:** You may of course start introducing reading the numbers whenever you like. However, don't let the reading limit the counting. Learning to read numerals will typically take longer than learning to say the numbers and getting a sense of the quantities.",

    "SourceText": "**It helps with meaning:** Counting down is surprisingly effective at solidifying understanding of the number sequence. Many very young children who have learned to count from 1 to 10 have a difficult time when they first try to count from 10 down to 1. This counting in the opposite order forces them to think in a fresh way about how the numbers are ordered. This will be particularly true when your child starts counting to 100 and they start thinking about what happens as they go from one decade to the next – say between 69 and 70.\n\n**It helps with subtraction:** Counting down is also very helpful with learning to subtract. A child who can count down will very quickly learn how to subtract 1 and 2. It is also helpful if counting down becomes automatic, so they can use their full attention on counting down the three steps when doing 9 subtract 3, for example.\n\n**Use when natural:** There are many times when counting down is the natural thing to do. If there are ten seconds left on a timer, you can count down together with the counter. If you say that something can be done three more times, then you can count down from three together.\n\n**Include 0:** It is usually natural to include 0 when counting down, and this is a good thing to do. If you are counting down the time remaining, when you reach 0 you have 0 seconds left. If you count down how many pieces of food your child can eat, when you reach 0 there will be no food left. It is helpful to make 0 a normal and expected quantity to work with.",

Create many, many experiences that allow your child to touch, feel, and directly experience the sizes of quanti- ties and how they compare.\n\n**Line them up:** One simple way to compare the sizes of two quantities is to line them up in 1-to-1 correspondence next to each other. For example, if you play a card game and you want to see who won, you can line up the cards of the two players and see which line has extra cards.\n\n**Common misunderstanding:** Be aware that a small child may think that two short sticks is the same amount as one long stick. This is perfectly understandable, but it is often not what the adult had in mind.\n\n**Give choices:** Put your child in situations where they can choose between two groups of of the same things they really like. When they pick the bigger group, reinforce it by saying that the chosen group had more than the other group.\n\n**Games:** You may be able to start playing simple card games, such as the game of \"War.\" Use the dots on the cards to allow your child to compare the quantities. Another good game to practice with is \"I'm Thinking of a Number,\" where you have a number line of cards with something hidden under one of the cards.\n\n**Number lines:** Number lines are an excellent visual aid for seeing which numbers are smaller (the ones on the left) and which are larger (the ones on the right).

As your child gets comfortable with seeing a group of objects as a quantity, start doing Counting On in front of them to help them get the idea of it.\n\n**Example:** Suppose your child has one row of 3 cards and another row of 4 cards. They can count all the cards one at a time \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\" and see that there are 7 cards. However, if your child recognizes that there are three cards in one row, they don't need to count those cards. They can start their counting at 3, pointing to the three cards on the first row, and then count the second row \"4, 5, 6, 7.\" Your child is Counting On starting at 3, and that's where the name comes from.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** Being able to Count On saves time and effort. It also signals that your child is getting comfortable seeing the quantity associated with a group of objects and can work with them as a group. This is a big conceptual leap that will be very useful to them in all the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing soon to come.\n\n**Connection with addition:** Beginning addition is strongly linked to counting. When given a card with three dots on it, and another card with four dots on it, a child asked to add these two quan- tities will count them from 1 to 7. It is faster and more powerful to do this adding of 3 and 4 by starting at 3, or 4, and counting on using the other number. You will see finger techniques for doing this in upcoming lessons.",

However, the ideas of One More and One Less are early and important steps for adding and subtracting.\n\n**Counting up and down:** One more and one less are strongly connected to the ideas of the next number and previous number when you are counting up and down. Counting practice with count- ing both directions will help make it easy for your child to know which number comes next and which number was the previous one.\n\n**Adding 1 and taking away 1:** Combine these ideas with adding and subtracting by asking ques- tions such as: \"How many pebbles do you have now? If I added 1 more, how many would you have? If I took 1 away so you had 1 less, how many would you have?\" These are very easy and natural questions to fit into everyday conversation, and your child can talk about them without ever considering that they are doing addition and subtraction.\n\nIf you have 3 of something and your child has four of that thing, you can discuss various possibilities. Would you have the same amount if you had one more? Would you have the same amount if your child has one less. Be playful with the idea. If your numbers are 3 and 5, you can talk about getting one more twice, or about one of you getting one more and the other getting one less.\n\n**Extend from 1 to 2:** When your child is ready, extend your child's understanding to what happens when you have two more or two less. There is no hurry to get to this, so please make sure your child first thoroughly understands one more and one less.\n\n**Games:** With this simple bit of arithmetic, you can start playing some games with adding and subtracting. A very simple one is to play the game of Nim with 1 and 2 using either addition or subtraction. Other games are Get Out of My House and Within 1 or 2",

    "SourceText": "**Adding by counting:** For a long time your child has been doing adding problems by counting. If they were asked to add two things to three things, that was done by counting all five things. As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things. This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Using fingers:** Children of this age will benefit greatly from having manipulatives to use when doing addition. It helps cement their understanding of the numbers in terms of quantities. Of course, the manipulative that is always available to them is their fingers. When doing our example of adding two to three, they can put up two fingers on one hand, three fingers on the other hand, and bring the two hands together. Another way to do it is to raise two fingers on one hand, raise three more fingers on that same hand, and then see a total of five fingers raised.\n\n**Add 0 sometimes:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually for your child.\n\n**Subtracting up to 5:** The ideas behind practicing subtraction are similar to those for addition. If your child is going to subtract three from five, have your chid raise five fingers and then lower three of them. Their familiarity with one less and two less will probably make subtracting one and two very easy.\n\n**Subtract 0 and everything sometimes:** Mix in questions where you subtract 0 sometimes. Also mix in questions where you subtract everything. For example, if you have three bits of food and you eat all of them, how many do you have left?\n\n**Memorizing:** As you ask your child to do various adding and subtracting problems that come along, your child will become more and more familiar with them and will eventually memorize them. While it is desirable to eventually make the recall of these facts automatic and easy for your child, there is no hurry.\n\n**Other math facts:** During this time your child's exposure to adding won't be restricted to those whose sum is 5 or less, and that is fine. For example, your child will probably have learned to add 1 or 2 to all the numbers up to 10. Your child may also have begun to learn the adding twin facts, such as 3 + 3 or 4 + 4.",
    "text": "**通過計數進行添加:** 長期以來，您的孩子一直在通過計數來解決加法問題。如果要求他們將兩件東西加到三件東西上，則通過計算所有五件東西來完成。隨著您的孩子掌握了「繼續計數」，部分計數被替換為從其中一個數字開始，例如本例中的 3，然後計算剩餘的兩個東西。這種計數經驗還使您的孩子能夠形象化和掌握「再加 1」和「再加 2」的概念，這使得 1 和 2 的加法變得容易得多。\n\n**使用手指:** 這個年齡段的孩子在做加法時如果能使用教具，將受益匪淺。它有助於鞏固他們對數字的數量理解。當然，他們隨時可以使用的教具就是手指。在做我們這個二加三的例子時，他們可以一隻手伸出兩根手指，另一隻手伸出三根手指，然後將兩隻手合在一起。另一種方法是一隻手伸出兩根手指，另一隻手伸出三根手指，然後看到總共伸出五根手指。\n\n**有時添加 0:** 有時還要加上 0。這很容易做到，而且對你的孩子來說，這在概念上很重要。\n\n**減去 5 以內:** 練習減法的思路與加法類似。如果你的孩子要從五中減去三，就讓他舉起五根手指，然後放下三根手指。他們對減一和減二的熟悉程度可能讓減一和減二變得非常容易。\n\n**有時減去 0 和所有值:** 有時，會混入減去 0 的問題。還會混入減去所有東西的問題。例如，如果你有三塊食物，你把它們全吃完了，你還剩下多少？\n\n**記憶:** 當你要求孩子做各種加減運算題時，孩子會越來越熟悉這些運算題，並最終記住它們。雖然希望孩子最終能夠自動輕鬆地記住這些運算題，但不必著急。\n\n**其他數學事實:** 在此期間，您的孩子接觸的加法不會僅限於總和為 5 或更少的數，這很好。例如，您的孩子可能已經學會了將 1 或 2 加到 10 以下的所有數字上。您的孩子可能還開始學習雙胞胎加法，例如 3 + 3 或 4 + 4。",

    "SourceText": "**Two kinds of subtraction:** There are two models for subtraction, and both are important. The first is taking away. If you are asked to subtract 3 things from 9 things, you will probably think of this as taking away or removing 3 of the things. The second model involves difference. The difference between two numbers is the distance between them . If you are asked to subtract 7 from 9, you are likely to do this be finding how far apart they are, what their difference is.\n\nBoth understandings of subtraction are needed and are useful. For mental arithmetic, having a choice of using take away or difference can make a big difference in the ease of the calculation. Additionally, some problems are more naturally understood as take away or difference problems.\n\n**Counting down:** Counting down is a natural way to do take away. Use 9 - 3 as an example of subtracting by counting down.\n\nAs with adding, your child may want to initially do this using their fingers, and that is fine. Say \"9\" and have a closed fist to indicate 0. Next, count down \"8, 7, 6\" and raise one finger with each number. Stop at 6, when three fingers have been raised.\n\nOver time, using fingers with small subtraction problems will become less necessary. Your child will start to mentally see the change of 3 in going from 9 to 6, and will no longer need to use fingers – just as they no longer need fingers for subtracting 1 or 2.\n\n**Subtracting 1 to 4:** With practice, your child will build up speed using this approach for subtracting the numbers from 1 to 4. Take your time and make sure everyone enjoys the process.",
    "text": "**兩種減法:** 減法有兩種模型，兩種都很重要。第一種是減法。如果要求你從 9 個東西中減去 3 個東西，你可能會認為這是減去或移除了 3 個東西。第二種模型涉及差值。兩個數字之間的差值就是它們之間的距離。如果要求你從 9 中減去 7，你很可能會通過找出它們之間的距離以及它們的差值來做到這一點。\n\n兩種對減法的理解都是必要的，也是有用的。對於心算來說，選擇使用減法或差法會對計算的難易程度産生很大的影響。此外，有些問題更自然地被理解為減法或差法問題。\n\n**倒數:** 倒數是進行減法的自然方法。以 9 - 3 為例，通過倒數進行減法。\n\n與加法一樣，您的孩子最初可能想用手指來做，這冇問題。說「9」，握緊拳頭錶示 0。接下來，倒數「8、7、6」，每數一個數字就舉起一根手指。舉起三根手指後，停在 6 處。\n\n隨著時間的推移，用手指做小減法題的必要性將逐漸降低。您的孩子將開始在腦海中看到從 9 到 6 的 3 的變化，並且不再需要使用手指——就像他們不再需要手指來減去 1 或 2 一樣。\n\n**減去 1 到 4:** 通過練習，您的孩子將使用此方法加快從 1 到 4 的減法速度。慢慢來，確保每個人都享受這個過程。",

Finding the difference is understood as finding the distance between the numbers, and this can be calculated by asking what number needs to be added to span the gap between them.\n\n**Counting On:** Use finding the difference of 9 and 6 as an example. Calculate this by keeping track of how many numbers you use as you Count On from 6 to 9. As with the instructions for adding in a previous learning step, this can be done with or without fingers. If your child has been practicing adding problems, they can probably very quickly count \"7, 8, 9\" and see that the gap is 3.\n\n**Subtracting and adding:** Using Counting On to find the difference is a great way to see the connec- tion between adding and subtracting. When we Counted On starting at 6 to add 6 + 3, we wanted to find the result of Counting On three times. When we Counted On from 6 to find 9 - 6, we knew the result of 9 and wanted to find out what we needed to add to 6 to get there.\n\n**Differences of 1 to 4:** With practice, your child will build up speed using this approach for finding differences of sizes 1 to 4.

Eventually, with numbers all the way up to 100 coming on the horizon, it will be time to Introduce your child to the role of 10 in the numbers from 10 to 20.\n\n**Adding and subtracting 10:** Start this introduction by helping your child learn how to add 10 to single-digit numbers and subtract 10 from double-digit numbers from 10 to 20.\n\n**Practice with physical quantities:** Find something you have a lot of – perhaps pebbles, sticks, or toothpicks. Let's use 3 and 13 as an example. If you place 13 things on a flat surface, you can separate them into one group of 10 and one group of 3. This demonstrates both that 3 + 10 is 13, and also that 13 - 10 is 3.\n\n**Numerals:** If your child is ready to use numerals, write down 13 = 10 + 3 and 13 - 10 = 3 as you do the demonstration just described. When we write a two-digit number, such as 13, the place on the left is the tens place and the place on the right is the ones place. Then tens place tells how many tens the number has, and the ones place how many ones it has. For 13, it is made up of 1 ten and 3 ones, so 13 = 10 + 3. As another example, 20 is made up of 2 tens and 0 ones.\n\n**It takes time:** Breaking up a number into tens and ones, particularly symbolically with written numbers, is a big conceptual step and you should expect this to take many demonstrations, many explanations, and lots of time.

The sums are also the numbers you get when you skip count by 2's, so that helps to reinforce these adding facts.\n\n**A foundation for doubling:** Knowing adding twins quickly leads to knowing how to double. Suppose you ask your child to double 3. They know that doubling something means to take two if it. So, doubling 3 means 3 plus 3, which is 6.\n\n**Near twins:** A pair of numbers is a near twin if they are one apart, such as 3 + 4. Once your child knows their adding twins, near twins is an easy next step. Think of 3 + 4 as 3 + 3 + 1, so it is 1 more than 3 + 3. So, 3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7. Alternatively, think of 3 + 4 as (4 - 1) + 3, which is 1 less than 4 + 4. So, 3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7. Allow your child to pick whichever approach they prefer for each near twin, or have fun doing them both ways.\n\nThis technique of using a familiar math fact to figure out a closely related math fact is powerful. It will help with learning many math facts in the months to come. Take your time and make sure your child thoroughly understands how this works.

This is connected to a surprising number of related concepts, as you will soon see.\n\n**Multiplying by 2:** Multiplying by 2 is the same as doubling. However, it uses interesting new wording that your child will need to get used to. When you first introduce the phrase of multiplying by 2, be sure to mix in the use of doubling from time to time to help with the transition. Your child will be getting used to the new words \"multiplying\" and \"times.\"\n\n**Half of something:** When something is doubled, such as 3 doubled is 6, then you can take half of the result and get back the original number. For example, suppose you picture 3 doubled as two rows of 3 things. Then taking half of those two matched rows is to take one of the rows, which is 3 things.\n\n**Equal sharing:** When you talk about taking half of something, you can combine that with the idea of sharing it equally among two people. If two people are to get equal shares, they will each get the same thing and that will be half of the original amount.\n\n**Dividing by 2:** If your child is comfortable with all the concepts so far in this learning step, then they are ready to talk about dividing! You can start talking about dividing something equally, or dividing it in two, or dividing by two. Mix together using all these phrases with your child – it will take time for them to absorb this new vocabulary. As far as the math is concerned, they have mastered all the ideas already!\n\n**Concrete examples:** Do lots of practice with each of these new ideas and words with groups of objects. Make your child's understanding be concrete rather than simply abstract. Anytime there is something to share among two people is a perfect time to practice. You can of course start extending this to sharing among more than two people if you like.\n\n**The beginning of multiplying and dividing:** As you have seen, this is the starting point of multi- plying and dividing.

It could well be that the first ten times you attempt to play the game your child will have fun with all the pieces and do many things that have nothing to do with the game. This is a process. Your child needs to become familiar with the game and its pieces, and the novelty needs to wear off a bit. You will know when your child is ready and your patience has paid off.\n\n**Play around:** At first, it is likely that your child won't really have a sense of winning and losing, and won't understand that their choices make a difference. That's okay. You are just there to have fun together. Over time, as the game and its choices become more familiar, your child will start to see that their choices make a difference and that they care about those differences.\n\n**Invisible math sometimes:** Strategy games don't always involve numeric components, but they are mathematical anyway.

    "SourceText": "**10's:** When your child's counting extends from 20 up to 100, the hard parts are the changes in 10's. Those are the parts to give special support and practice. Once your child knows the sequence of the 10's, it is usually very easy for them to fill in the changes in 1's. For example, they will quickly learn to count \"70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.\"\n\n**Skip count by 10's:** When your child gets stuck counting between 1 and 100, it is usually at a transition in 10's. Typical questions to help your child get unstuck are: \"What comes next after the 60's?\" or \"What comes before the 50's?\" Practice skip counting by 10's to help with this. If your child can produce the 10's from 0 to 100 forward and backward, then they will be ready to answer those questions about which 10's come next or before.\n\n**Use objects:** Make this counting have more meaning by practicing it using a large group of small objects, such as pebbles. Gather together 100 of these objects and put them in a big pile off to the side. As your child counts up from one, pull over one object at a time with each number and include it in the current group of objects. Each time a group of ten objects is formed, put that group together in a special tens area. As the numbers increase, the tens area will have more and more groups of tens. By the time your child is in the 50's, there should be five groups of ten and a small collection of left over ones.\n\nYou can also do this practice in reverse by starting with ten groups of tens and then taking away one at a time as your child counts down from 100.\n\n**Count both directions:** Children often become really good counting quickly and automatically upward from 1 to 100, but then have trouble counting in the opposite direction. Counting from 100 to 1 forces more thought about the 10's transitions and helps with understanding the numbers better in general.\n\n**100 number chart:** Having a ten by ten 100 number chart going from 1 to 100, or from 0 to 99, will help your child see the pattern of the numbers. It will make it particularly clear how the tens place stays the same for ten numbers and the ones place keeps changing.",
    "text": "**10 的:** 當您的孩子從 20 數到 100 時，最難的部分是 10 的變化。這些是需要特別支援和練習的部分。一旦您的孩子知道了 10 的順序，他們通常很容易填寫 1 的變化。例如，他們會很快學會數「70、71、72、73、74、75、76、77、78、79」。\n\n**按 10 跳過計數:** 當您的孩子在 1 到 100 之間數數時遇到睏難，通常是在 10 的過渡階段。幫助您的孩子擺脫睏境的典型問題是：「60 之後是什麼？」或「50 之前是什麼？」練習以 10 為單位跳過計數以幫助解決這個問題。如果您的孩子可以從 0 到 100 正嚮和反嚮數出 10，那麼他們將準備好回答關於哪些 10 在下一個或之前的問題。\n\n**使用物體:** 通過使用一大堆小物體（如鵝卵石）進行練習，讓計數更有意義。收集 100 個這樣的物體，將它們堆放在一邊。當您的孩子從一開始數數時，每次拉一個帶有每個數字的物體，並將其包含在當前的物體組中。每當形成一組十個物體時，就將該組放在一個特殊的十位數區域。隨著數字的增加，十位數區域將有越來越多的十位數組。等您的孩子數到 50 時，應該有五組十位數和一小堆剩餘的個位數。\n\n您也可以反嚮練習，從十組十開始，然後隨著您的孩子從 100 倒數，一次減去一個。\n\n**計算兩個方嚮:** 孩子們通常能夠快速而自如地從 1 數到 100，但反過來數卻有睏難。從 100 數到 1 會迫使他們更多地思考 10 的過渡，並有助於更好地理解數字。\n\n**100 數字圖錶:** 擁有一張從 1 到 100 或從 0 到 99 的十乘十 100 數字錶，將幫助您的孩子看到數字的規律。它將特別清楚地說明十位數字保持不變，而個位數字不斷變化。",

    "SourceText": "**Number meaning:** Seeing a two-digit number as some number of tens and ones is central to understanding and working with those numbers. Doing two-digit addition and subtraction requires fluency with the concepts of place value. Develop that understanding through lots of experiences with physical objects and written numbers.\n\n**Bundles of tens:** Take something you have lots of, make a large pile of it, and put some of them in a few bundles of ten. For example, out of that large pile ask your child to gather 23 of them. Then ask your child to group them in groups of ten. They will form two groups of ten and 3 singles. See what happens with the groups of ten in these 23 things as you put in some additional items or take some away, always making sure that there are no more than 9 single items at any time.\n\n**Expanded form:** The expanded form of a number is writing it as a sum of its place value parts. For example, 23 would be written as 20 + 3, and 256 would be written as 200 + 50 + 6. Practice with your child converting in both directions between a number's usual form and its expanded form. Point out that the expanded form of a number is the same as taking that many things and bundling them into groups of ten and have ones left over.\n\n**Counting with tick marks:** Counting using groups of five tick marks is a natural thing people like to do and is strongly related to place value. If you are counting 23 things with tick marks, you will end up with 4 bundles of 5 and 3 tick marks left over. Those 4 bundles of 5 can be reorganized as 2 bundles of 2 groups of 5, which is our expanded form view of 23.\n\n**Skip counting:** Skip counting by various numbers is a way to build mental practice with adding or subtracting single-digit and double-digit numbers. Although it is a great way to practice, this does require some mental steps that not every child will be ready for at this point – there is no hurry. Here are two examples. With lots of practice, these thinking steps will become automatic.\n\nSkip count upward by 8 starting at 23. Think of 23 as 20 plus 3 more. Using the number bonds for 10, 3 will need 7 more to make a group of 10. Use 7 out of the 8 being added so that 3 plus 7 forms another group of 10. So, 23 + 8 becomes 20 + 10 + 1, which is 31.\n\nSkip count downward by 5 starting at 23. Break up 5 into 3 and 2. To subtract 5, we will first take away 3 and then take away 2. 23 subtract 3 brings us to 20, which we will think of as 10 + 10. Subtracting the remaining 2 from one of those 10's leaves 8, so our answer is 10 + 8, which is 18.",

    "SourceText": "**Useful and easier than you think:** Compensation is a useful mental arithmetic tool for simplifying addition and subtraction calculations of all sizes. Understanding it also increases number sense for addition and subtraction. It is simpler than it sounds.\n\nFor example, suppose you were adding 99 + 15. You would recognize that 99 needs just one more to make 100, a number that is much easier to work with than 99. So you would move 1 from the 15 to the 99 – you would have the same total number of things, but they are distributed in a way that's easier to work with. This problem becomes 100 + 14, which is very easy to do. This is the kind of thing we'll be doing.\n\n**Compensation for addition:** The idea is to give or take some small amount to make one of the numbers easier to work with. We will typically be making one of the numbers into a multiple of 10. Suppose you are adding 8 + 7. The 8 just needs 2 more to become 10, so take that 2 away from the 7. This makes 8 + 7 into 10 + 5, which is easy. We could also have done this problem by giving 3 to the 7 to make it 10. In that case, we'd turn 8 + 7 into 5 + 10.\n\n**More compensation for addition:** There are other possibilities for using compensation in addition problems. Consider 6 + 8 for example. The 6 could give 2 to the 8 to make this problem 4 + 10. However, the 8 could give 1 to the 6 to make this 7 + 7, an adding twins problem. Challenge each other to think of different ways for doing a given adding problem.\n\n**Compensation for subtraction:** For subtraction, we will add the same amount or subtract the same amount from both numbers. This will keep the distance between them the same but will make them easier to work with. Typically that will mean turning the number we're subtracting into a multiple of 10. Suppose we are subtracting 13 - 8. If we add 2 to both numbers, then the distance between stays the same, but now we are subtracting 15 - 10, which is easy. Similarly, if we were asked to do 17 - 13, we could subtract 3 from both numbers and turn it into 14 - 10. Alternatively, we could subtract 10 from both numbers and turn it into 7 - 3.",

These games have a lot to offer children mathematically, even when there is no explicit numerical content. In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving.\n\n**An introduction to Nim:** Now that your child has been playing strategy games for a while, it is time to look into how to get more out of them. Let's use the game of Nim as an example. This game has some very simple rules: Pick a starting number, say 10, and a person to go first. Players alternate turns choosing to subtract 1 or 2 from the running total. The person who reaches 0 wins. The arithmetic is simple enough, but the strategy is challenging.\n\n**Learning from experience:** If you imagine you are playing any game against an extremely capable opponent, the game becomes a puzzle. How can I find the move that let's me have my best chance of winning no matter how well my opponent plays? One strategy is to play the game many times and pay attention to what seems to work and what doesn't. This approach is a good start and it does provide the opportunity for observation and insights. This can be a slow method of learning, and it may be very hard to find patterns in complicated games – imagine all the possibilities if we picked the starting number of 100 for Nim!\n\n**Solving Nim:** Can we look ahead a few moves and figure out good moves that way? That is hard to do starting at 10. If we start at 5, it's pretty easy to do. If we subtract 2, the new number will be 3. No matter whether the other play subtracts 1 or 2 at this point, we will win. So, if we are at the number 5, we know how to win. What happens with other small starting numbers? Can we find a pattern that will tell us which starting numbers will be winners and which will be losers? Can we explain why that pattern is true?\n\n**The goal:** If we follow this line of attack, we will completely solve how to play the game of Nim. What worked for Nim may or may not work for another game. This is problem solving, and each new problem can bring fresh challenges and a need for new ideas. And that is the fun. Share this attitude of puzzling and being challenged to your child. As they play a strategy game, discuss with them their ideas about what would make for a better or worse move at that moment. The point isn't so much to find the perfect move as it is to enjoy looking for it and having a discussion about it with people who they can enjoy sharing ideas with.",

The difficulty here is that it is not so easy to have hundreds of objects in the first place, and it can also be unwieldy to deal with such a large collection. In addition to having groups of ones and tens of some object, one strategy is to use symbolic place holders for large groups, such as 100s. You could have several pieces of paper or wood on which you have written \"100.\"\n\n**Use objects:** Practice having your child represent various quantities using objects grouped in ones, tens, and hundreds. For example, ask how 325 would be represented using these objects. Include examples such as 206, 430, and 500 that have zero things in one or more categories. Also, lay out collections of ones, tens, and hundreds and ask your child to name the number for this quantity.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Once your child is thoroughly comfortable with the connection between numbers and their quantities, start using numerals and expanded form to represent the numbers. Take a number, such as 325, for example. Represent it with quantities for hundreds, tens, and ones, and then use the quantity representation to write the number in expanded form as 325 = 300 + 20 + 5. Do this same practice in the opposite direction by writing 100 + 40 + 6, representing it with physical groups of hundreds, tens, and ones of objects, and then asking what the total number is.",

    "SourceText": "**Single digit:** A gentle introduction to working with two two-digit numbers is to have one of them be a single-digit number. One of the best ways to practice adding or subtracting a single-digit number with a double-digit number is to do skip counting using various skip sizes, going up or down, and starting at any number. The following methods for two two-digit numbers will of course work when one of the numbers is a single-digit number.\n\n**Use objects:** Grounding your child's understanding by using physical objects is always a good idea. Start by representing both of the numbers with groups of tens and ones.\n\n**Adding:** If you are adding the two numbers, put all the groups together and discuss the result. If you are adding two numbers, such as 23 and 45, that is all you need to do. However, if you are adding 23 and 48, the two groups of ones form at least a group of ten. Talk about how that changes the total number of tens you have from 6 to 7. This is called regrouping.\n\n**Subtracting:** If you are subtracting, start by removing the tens being subtracted from the bigger number and then attempt to remove the appropriate number of ones. For example, if you are subtracting 23 from 45, then there are enough ones and you are done. If there are not enough ones, such as if you are subtracting 28 from 45, then discuss how one of the groups of tens needs to be broken up and included with the ones. The original grouping of 45 as 4 tens and 5 ones becomes a grouping of 3 tens and 15 ones. This is also called regrouping.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Use objects for double-digit adding and subtracting until your child thoroughly understands the process and why regrouping makes sense when it is needed. At this point, move to representing the adding and subtracting with numbers written in expanded form. When working with numbers in expanded form, the process and the steps are exactly the same as they were when you were working with groups of tens and ones – and that is the point.\n\n**Making it automatic:** Over time and with lots of practice, your child will stop needing to use groups of tens and ones or expanded form. However, as with so many other things, there is no hurry getting to that point – it will come with practice.",

Use 6 times 9 as an example. For the answer, put one less than the number in the tens place (which is 5), and subtract the tens place from 9 to get the ones place (which is 4). So 6 times 9 is 54. As you'll see, this is no different than subtracting 6 from 6 times 10, but somehow it feels like more fun.\n\n**One more and one less:** Use the idea of one more or one less to learn these based on other numbers you now know how to multiply by. The numbers 3, 6, and 11 are one more than numbers you already know. For example, 6 times 7 is one more 7 than 5 times 7. So 6 times 7 is 7 + 35, which is 42.\n\nThe numbers 4 and 9 are one less than numbers you already know. For example, 4 times 7 is one less 7 than 5 times 7. So 4 times 7 is 35 - 7, which is 28.",
    "text": "**幾種策略:** 這些被歸類在這裏是因為它們可以通過多一或少一的方法來做，稍後會介紹。但是，其中一些可以用其他方式來完成。如果您的孩子喜歡這種方法，它們都可以用跳數來完成。乘以 4 是乘以 2 的兩倍。乘以 6 是乘以 3 的兩倍。乘以 11 非常簡單，幾乎不需要任何練習。\n\n乘以 9 有一個特殊規則，有些孩子很喜歡。以 6 乘以 9 為例。答案是，在十位上放置一個比數字少的數字（即 5），然後用 9 減去十位得到個位（即 4）。所以 6 乘以 9 等於 54。正如你所見，這與從 6 乘以 10 中減去 6 冇什麼不同，但不知何故感覺更有趣。\n\n**多一個，少一個:** 使用多一或少一的思想，根據你現在知道如何乘以的其他數字來學習這些。數字 3、6 和 11 比你已經知道的數字多一。例如，6 乘以 7 比 5 乘以 7 多一個 7。所以 6 乘以 7 等於 7 + 35，也就是 42。\n\n4 和 9 比您已知的數字少 1。例如，4 乘以 7 比 5 乘以 7 少 1。因此 4 乘以 7 等於 35 - 7，也就是 28。",

For example, 3 is a divisor of 6 because 3 divides into 6 exactly 2 times. 4 is not a divisor by 6 because it goes into it 1 1/2 times. The word factor means the same thing as divisor.\n\n**Common divisors:** In some mathematical situations, particularly with simplifying fractions, it is useful to find numbers that evenly divide two given numbers. Such numbers are called common divisors or common factors. The common divisors of 20 and 8 are 1, 2, and 4. You may enjoy exploring together why all the common divisors for a pair of numbers are divisors of the greatest of the common divisors.\n\n**Multiples:** A multiple of a number is anything that can be produced by multiplying the number by a whole number. For example, some multiples of 6 are 0, 6, 12, and 18. Notice that any multiple of a number has that number as a divisor. For example, each of the multiples of 6 has 6 as a divisor.\n\n**Common multiples:** A number which is a multiple of two given numbers is said to be a common multiple for them. Some common multiples of 6 and 4 are 0, 12, 24, and 36. Notice that all the common multiples are multiples of the least of the positive common multiples.

A prime number is a number larger than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and itself. The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are the first few prime numbers.\n\n**Composites and 1:** There are three kinds of positive whole numbers: 1 (which is called a unit), primes, and composites. Composites can be thought of as being constructed from primes. For example, 12 is 2 times 2 times 3. Every number larger than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely written as a product of two or more primes.\n\n**Prime factorizations:** Getting to know prime factorizations really well will be very helpful for many parts of the math your child is about to learn. Repeating the prime factorizations of the numbers up to 20, or even 30, is a good exercize for getting to know these factorizations. Simply go through the list of numbers in order like this: 1 - unit, 2 - prime, 3 - prime, 4 - 2 times 2, 5 - prime, 6 - 2 times 3, 7 - prime, 8 - 2 times 2 times 2, 9 - 3 times 3, and 10 - 2 times 5.\n\n**Powers:** Prime factorizations often involve repeated prime factors, so this is a good time to learn about powers and to practice them. It is quicker and easier to understand to say \"2 to the fourth\" than it is to say \"2 times 2 times 2 times 2.\" 2 squared means 2 times 2, and 2 cubed means 2 times 2 times 2.",

Similar to what was done for addition and subtraction, group multiplication and division facts by families to gain a deeper understanding of them. For example, 3 x 4 = 12, 4 x 3 = 12, 12 / 3 = 4, and 12 / 4 = 3 form a fact family.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing are related:** For the 3 x 4 = 12 fact family, visualize this interconnection using a rectangle that is 3 by 4. The area of this rectangle is 12, which is 3 times 4 or 4 times 3 – its width times its length. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of width 3, the length must be 4. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of length 4, its width must be 3. All these facts are tied together.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing undo each other:** Let's continue to use the example of 3 times 4. If we start with 3 and multiply it by 4 we arrive at 12. If we then take 12 and divide it by 4, the result is back to 3. Multiplying by 4 and then dividing by 4 gets back to where we started.\n\nSimilarly, if we take 12 and divide by 4 the answer is 3.

All those skills should be well mastered and understood before starting in on general single-digit division.\n\n**No remainder:** Division problems where the divisor goes in evenly without a remainder are mostly done by your child recognizing the corresponding multiplication fact. For example, if they are asked to divide 36 by 4, then remembering that 4 times 9 is 36 will get them straight to the answer. However, if that method doesn't work for a given problem, then they should use the next method.\n\n**Guessing and skip counting:** Suppose your child is asked to divide 29 by 4. Your child will not find 29 among their multiplication facts involving 4, so they will want to find a result that is less than 29 that does work. Have your child guess at a multiple of 4 that is less than 29. They might guess 24, which is 4 times 6. They can then skip count forward until they bump into 29. In this case that will mean moving forward to 28, which is 4 times 7. Seeing that they have to stop there, they have their answer that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n\n**Checking the answer:** Checking their answers is a good habit for your child to develop. In this last example, we think we found that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1. Check this by multiplying 4 times 7 to get 28, and then adding 1 to get 29. So it all checks out!",

If your child doesn't remember how to do a calculation, discuss with them the methods they know for figuring it out.
