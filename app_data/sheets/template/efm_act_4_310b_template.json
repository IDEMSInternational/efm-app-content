The remaining cards become a draw pile, and its top card is flipped over to start the discard pile. The goal is to hold seven cards that are broken into separate groups of one or more cards that add up to the target. During a turn, the player has the choice of picking up the top card of the discard pile or the unseen card at the top of the draw pile. That player then discards a card. When a player successfully fills their whole hand, the player lays down the hand and says “Gin!”\n\nTaking the difference with pairs of cards can be used instead of addition. In that case, deal an even number of cards to each player.",
