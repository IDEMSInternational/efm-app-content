Learning these provides another foundation for learning other multiplication facts.\n\n**Doubling**\n\nUse this strategy for multiplying by even numbers. For example, the result of 6 x 7 is the double of 3 x 7. So, 6 x 7 is the double of 21, which is 42.\n\n**One More or One Less**\n\nThis strategy is effective for the remaining multiplication facts. For example, 9 x 7 is one 7 less than 10 x 7 = 70. So it is 70 - 7 = 63. This can be done for all the 9’s. Similarly, 3 x 7 is one more 7 than doubling 7, so it is 7 + 14 = 21. This can be done for all the 3’s.\n\n**Multiplying by 9**\n\nAlthough multiplying by 9 is covered by the last strategy, they are fun to learn in their own right. If you write out the multiples of 9 in order, you’ll see that the tens digit is always one less than the number you are multiplying by and the ones digit plus the tens digit always adds up to 9!",
