For each number, investigate which rectangles you can make with that many objects. 1 can only be made with a 1 by 1 rectangle, and 1 is called a unit. The numbers, such as 5, that only have 1 by 5 and 5 by 1 rectangles, are called primes. Numbers that are not a unit or prime are called composite - they are called that because they are composed of primes being multiplied together, such as 12 = 2 x 2 x 3.\n\nThe dimensions of each rectangle are made of values that evenly divide the number and multiply together to give the number. Making rectangles is a direct way to experience divisibility. Numbers such as 16 are called squares because one of their rectangles is a square â€“ one rectangle for 16 is the 4 by 4 square.",
