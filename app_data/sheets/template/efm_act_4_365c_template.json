The poison numbers can be any set of numbers you want your child to practice with. Some examples are: \n\n* even numbers\n* odd numbers\n* square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16)\n* prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)\n* multiples of a number, such as 3\n\nEach player starts with three cards. The first player discards a number that is not a poison number and replaces it from the draw pile. The next player discards a number so that the sum of the first two numbers is not a poison number and replaces the discard from the draw pile. The next player plays so that the sum of the three cards is not a poison number, and so on. The first player unable to discard a legal card loses. This game works equally well with more than two players.",
