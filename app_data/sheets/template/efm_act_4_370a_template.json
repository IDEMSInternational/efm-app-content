Let your child spend time with them, wrestle with them, and have the satisfaction of figuring them out.\n\nMake a triangle of six circles with three circles on a side. Use each of the numbers from 1 to 6 once so that each side of the triangle has the same sum. This involves two challenges - finding out which sums will work and then figuring out how to get those sums. It is better to let your child play with this to figure out which sums are possible, but if frustration wins out, the possible sums are 9, 10, 11, and 12.",
