The aim of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their dominoes. \n\nTo start, a random domino is placed face up in the middle. After that, a player must match the top domino in the middle. Matching means that the two numbers on the top domino can be combined with any operation – add, subtract, or even multiply if you want – to make the same result as some, possibly different, operation acting on the two numbers of one of your dominoes. For example, if [1,5] is on top, then it matches [2,4] because 1+5 = 2+4, and it also matches [2,2] because 5-1 = 2x2. The matching domino is placed on top of the previous top. If you can’t make a match, you must pick up a new domino from the pile.",
