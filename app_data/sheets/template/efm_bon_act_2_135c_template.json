It also means you should take it very slowly so your child has lots of success and fun, and very little frustration.\n\nThe rules for these 4 by 4 Sudokus are very simple. There are four different types of tokens. There should be one of each kind of token in each row, column, and 2 by 2 corner of the puzzle. Use moveable pieces so that it is easy for your child to experiment in finding solutions.\n\nThe first puzzles you make should just have one token missing from each row. Once your child understands and figures out those puzzles, you can move to trickier ones, but do not be in a hurry.\n\nThe easiest way to create these puzzles is to start with a finished Sudoku and remove some of the tokens. To help you to do that, there are a number of finished Sudokus supplied below. After those finished examples, there is a list of methods you can use to create puzzles from a finished puzzle.",
