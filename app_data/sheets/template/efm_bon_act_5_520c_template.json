In these, one or more of the digits are replaced by letters. The three rules for letters are: \n\n* A given letter is always the same digit\n* The leftmost digit of a number is never 0\n* Different letters must be different digits\n\nCreate these puzzles by taking an addition or subtraction problem and replacing one or more of the digits. The puzzles can also be created to make interesting problem-solving challenges for your child. Note that the values of the letters do not carry over from puzzle to puzzle.",
