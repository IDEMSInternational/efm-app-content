At this point, your child’s choices are quite limited, but it is still a lot of fun to play around with. It will be particularly difficult to do many of the numbers without dividing or using decimals. Don’t be concerned with coming up with all the numbers in order - just come up with as many different numbers as possible.\n\nHere are a few examples just to get you started.\n\n1 = (4/4) x (4/4) = 44 / 44\n2 = 4 / ((4 + 4) / 4)\n3 = (4 + 4 + 4) / 4\n4 = (4 - 4) x 4 + 4\n6 = 4 + (4 + 4) / 4\n7 = 44 / 4 - 4\n8 = (4 + 4) x (4/4) = 4 + 4 + 4 - 4\n32 = 4 x 4 + 4 x 4\n\nc) Play around with having other single numbers and creating other results.",
