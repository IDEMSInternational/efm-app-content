The subregions are marked with a “+” or a “-” to indicate whether to take a sum or difference.\n\nTo vary the math calculations, use different groups of numbers instead of the usual 1 to 4 for a 4 by 4. For example, use the numbers 1, 3, 5, and 7. If you do this, list the numbers above the puzzle so your child will know what to use.",
