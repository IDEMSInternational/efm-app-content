Players take turns placing a token, with the Odd player going first. The first player to complete 3 in a row whose sum is 15 wins. One variation is to keep going, fill all the squares, and see which player made the most 15â€™s. \n\nA related game is to have an attacker and a defender. The attacker goes first (the first move cannot be a 5 in the center) and tries to get 15, and the defender tries to stop the attacker.",
