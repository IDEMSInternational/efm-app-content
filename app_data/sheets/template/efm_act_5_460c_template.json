Remember that 1 is a unit and not a prime!\n\nHere are some good questions to discuss with your child as they play with this sieve:\n\n* Why are the numbers pulled down primes?\n* What is the last prime whose multiples you need to cross out? Why were the other primes not useful?\n* For all the primes that were useful, which of their multiples produced new restrictions and which were not useful?\n* If you had a number, say 53, which prime numbers would you need to divide it by to confirm that it’s a prime?",
