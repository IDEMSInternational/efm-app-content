The Puzzler thinks of a number and the Questioner discovers the number. The Puzzler declares, “I am thinking of a number from 0 to 8” (or whatever upper limit they like). The Questioner then asks questions of the form “How does your number compare to 3?” The Puzzler answers that the number is smaller, equal to, or larger than that number. \n\nHere is an example of a game with a target of 5:\n\nPuzzler: I’m thinking of a number from 0 to 8. Question: How does your number compare to 3?\nPuzzler: My number is larger than 3.",
