          "value": "Without analyzing anything, this game is enjoyable to play and it provides good practice with adding or subtracting 1 and 2. We could leave it at that. However, it is also a great example of two problem solving techniques that you can show to your child when they are ready: 1) learning from simpler examples, and 2) looking for patterns.\n\nAny of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position. Continuing in this way, build up a table of results:\n\n1W - 2W - 3L - 4W - 5W - 6L - 7W - 8W - 9L - 10W",

          "value": "This table makes it obvious that there is a repeating pattern of 3. When starting at 10, you should want to go first and subtract 1. What is satisfying about this is that, once you decide to look at simpler versions of the problem, the analysis is quick and easy - no tricky analysis needed. Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n\nBut wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1.",
