Use a set of 15 pieces of paper the size of the grid squares, and number the pieces of paper from 1 to 15. The puzzle starts by having someone place the pieces of paper on the grid. The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty. To achieve this, a piece of paper can be moved if it is adjacent to the empty square - in which case it can be slid into that space. Depending on how the person sets up the puzzle, the puzzle may or may not be solvable.",

The number of numbered pieces of paper will always be one less than the size of the grid. For example, on a 2 x 3 grid use the cards from 1 to 5.\n\nTo create these puzzles, you have two options. The first is to place the squares randomly, in which case you have a 50 / 50 chance of the position being solvable. Alternatively, you can start by placing the pieces of paper in the final position and then making a series of legal moves to move the paper around. When you are all done, you are guaranteed that the puzzle is solvable.",
