For example, for a very young child this might be the cards 1 to 4 in the four suits. \n\nTwo cards are dealt to each player - one is face up and one is face down (the receiving player is the only one to look at the face down card). During a turn, the player has the option of asking for one more card until the player decides to stop. After every player has had a turn, the players compare the sum of their cards. The player with the sum closest to the target without going over wins.",
