Additionally, if there is a less than or greater than symbol between two cells, then the numbers in the cells must obey that relationship. \n\nMake these puzzles by using a finished Sudoku puzzle - all the example Number Sudoku Jigsaw puzzles given early in these Resources will be useful in creating these puzzles. Put in greater than and less than signs on a blank grid of the same geometry. If you omit all the numbers and put in all the inequalities (less than or greater than), it is generally fairly easy to solve the puzzle. A useful strategy for your child is to first look for where the smallest and largest numbers should go.",
