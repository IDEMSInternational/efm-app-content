Roll a die or pick a random playing card from 1 to 9. Each player chooses to use this number in their 1’s or 10’s column for the current row. For example, if it is a 4, this can become 4 or 40. The chosen number is added to the running total. A player that goes over the target of 100 “goes bust” and loses. If neither player goes bust, the one closer to 100 wins. \n\nThere are many options for this game:\n\n* Use a different target number.\n* Use fewer or more rows.\n* Don’t go bust if you go over the target. The closer player on either side wins.\n* Use a fourth column of 100’s to practice 3-digit numbers.\n* Practice subtraction by starting at the target number and subtract down to 0.",
