          "value": "Using compensation for addition is a way to make addition problems much easier. The idea is to take an amount away from one of the numbers being added and give it to the other other number - the result stays the same, but one of the numbers becomes easier to work with. \n\nFor example, when you add 7 + 8, if you take 2 away from 7 and give it to the 8, the problem becomes 5 + 10. Alternatively, if you take 3 away from the 8 and give it to the 7, the problem becomes 10 + 5. Anytime you can make one of the numbers a multiple of 10, you will have a much simpler problem.\n\nThese puzzles provide practice in creating new problems using compensation. The challenge is to find a path that connects all the islands with the same answer. It is only legal to connect two islands if their problem’s numbers differ by 1. Only some of the islands will be on the path.\n\nMake these puzzles by starting with about ten islands with some connections. Identify a path from one edge of the islands to the other. Along that path, put problems that differ from each other by one - perhaps start with a problem that involves adding 10, and then make variations on it. In the islands near to the path, put problems with small changes that have different answers.",
