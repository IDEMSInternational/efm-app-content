So, 3 x 6 is 6 more than double 6, which is 6 + 12.\n\nMultiplying a number by 4 is doubling a number and doubling it again. So, 4 x 7 is 2 x (2 x 7), which is 14 + 14.\n\nAt this point, your child should be comfortable quickly doing all the multiplying up to 5 times 5, which is a huge leap forward!",
