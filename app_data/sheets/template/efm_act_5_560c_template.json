          "value": "Have two sets of cards, say from 1 to 25. Play the standard game of war with these, only now the winner is the card that has more factors. For example, 12 beats 16 because 12 has 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12) while 16 has 5 factors (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16). The holder of the winning card must be able to correctly list the factors to win the cards - otherwise, the cards get shuffled back into each playerâ€™s draw pile. As with standard War, when there is a tie, then next cards are turned over and the winner receives all the cards.\n\nThere are several possible variations for you to play around with. You can play that the smaller number of factors wins. You can count the total of just the prime factors rather than all the factors. You can play that prime powers (numbers that are a power of a prime) beat other numbers.",
