Use a 4 by 5 grid on a paper with 20 spaces randomly filled out with multiples of 5 and 10. Have a set of tokens for each player. Select a random card and put your token on that number times 5 or 10 - your choice. Once occupied, the other player cannot move there. The first player to get 3 in a row wins. \n\nThe numbers 5 and 10 can be replaced by other pairs such as 2 and 4, or 3 and 6. These pairings help with practicing doubling strategies for multiplication. For example, if the player does not know 6 x 7, they can double 3 x 7.",
