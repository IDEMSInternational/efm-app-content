Though it takes a few steps, don’t be put off by them - with a little practice they become quick and easy. \n\nStart by taking a standard sheet of paper and folding at one of the corners so the sides marked A and B meet. Leave the fold in place and cut along the line marked C.\n\nTake the triangle produced and fold it in half so that sides AB and C overlap.\n\nPut a temporary fold in this triangle and use the fold to mark the middle of side ABC. Undo the temporary fold.\n\nMake a fold over F. When you fold over F, you will be looking to have G placed so that G breaks the angle in half. \n\nFold along G - do this fold underneath so that this new folded piece is underneath the other paper.\n\nAlthough not strictly necessary, it is a good idea to slice off the top of this figure. Otherwise, you might be tempted to use the region above the red dotted line without realizing that there isn’t paper on all levels.\n\nLastly, fold this triangle in half. At last you are all set to do the cutting of your design!\n\nHave fun experimenting with many different combinations of cuts and colors!",
