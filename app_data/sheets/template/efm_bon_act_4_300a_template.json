For example, all squares must have the same value and all hexagons would have the same value. You can optionally add the rule that different non-circular shapes must have different values - for example, that squares and hexagons must have different values.\n\nThe puzzle for your child is to figure out the numbers in the shapes and regions that are not supplied.",
