Be open to discussing whatever your child comes up with. \n\nIf you have a 3-unit and a 5-unit weight to put on one side of a lever, which weights can you put at which distances on the other side? This question continues the questions on the Make It Count page at the end of Chapter 4. As before, explore different combinations of weights. What happens if 3 and 5 are replaced by 4 and 5, 4 and 9, or 6 and 9?\n\nHow does this last problem change if we put the 3-unit and 5-unit weights on opposite sides of the fulcrum? Now it is easy to weigh a 1-unit weight by using 3 x 2 = 5 x 1 + 1 x 1. What other weights can you weigh this way?",

Each arm in the mobile is a lever that needs balancing, so these puzzles are an extension of the Lever Balance - practice those puzzles before starting these.\n\nStart with the simplest mobiles, which are just levers in the air. Here is a solution for putting the weights from 1 to 4 on this mobile to balance it. This works as a lever with the fulcrum at the hanging point.

For example, the weight on the left side is 1 + 3 = 4 – as far as the next level up is concerned, it does not matter where on that bottom arm the weights are located.
