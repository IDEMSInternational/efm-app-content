Flipping over any other card in the same row or column as the 63 would indicate where the 7 and 9 are. Suppose the second card they flipped over was where the 56 is. Not only would they know that the third column was for 7, they would also know that the second row was for 9 and the third row was for 8.\n\nLarger sizes also work. For example, a table with 5 blank rows and columns that allows for up to 12 flips will work well.\n\nPick numbers for the top and left sides that you want your child to practice with.",
