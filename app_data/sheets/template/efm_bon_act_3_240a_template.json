This section will look at five of these Sudoku variations. These all follow the rule of the “Latin Square” - that every number occurs exactly once in each row and column.\n\nYou can make any of these Sudokus by starting with a filled in puzzle of the appropriate type - either a Latin Square or a Jigsaw Sudoku. All of the Sudoku solutions given in the Bonus Material for Chapters 1-2 should be of use to you for this. After you have a solution in hand, add the additional information needed for this special kind of puzzle and remove some or all of the numbers.",
