This is easy to play orally whenever you have a spare moment. Here are some examples to get you started..\n\nSuppose you had a calculator with +, -, x, and /, but only one working number key, the 4. Could you get the result 21? If so, what is the fewest number of steps you would need? Suppose you could use 4 at most four times - which numbers could you produce? Suppose you had to use the 4 exactly four times. Play around with having other single keys and creating other results.\n\nSuppose your calculator could only add 4 or 7. Which numbers could you produce? Suppose it had 4 or 7, but now it can add and subtract. Which numbers could you produce? This is the same activity weâ€™ve seen in other settings.\n\nSuppose you only had a 1 key and could only add or double. For example, 2 x (2 x 1) + 1 is 5. What other numbers can you create?",
