          "value": "Hereâ€™s a fun way to make a long addition problem into a much simpler problem. Use an adding problem that has several number bonds for 10. Instead of adding 3 + 8 + 9 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 2 the usual way from left to right, rearrange the terms to put the number bonds together. This example would become (3 + 7) + (8 + 2) + (4 + 6) + 9, which is just 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nOnce this is easy, include trickier problems such as 4 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 3, which can be rearranged as  (8 + 9 + 3) + 4 + 5 = 20 + 9 = 29. Have your child make a habit of looking for ways to simplify long expressions to make these calculations easier.",
