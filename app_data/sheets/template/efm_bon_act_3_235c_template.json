The goal for each token is to be the first to get all the way to the right across the page.\n\nLet your child come up with some questions to investigate. Some natural questions are:\n\n* Which token will win and why? \n* Which tokens do well and which ones do poorly? \n* Which token is the worst?\n* How will the winners change if the rows are changed to have fewer squares or more squares?\n\nHave your child explain their ideas about the answers to these questions, and then investigate their ideas by running experiments.\n\nAdd a competitive element to this by guessing which token will win before the round starts.",

However, the difference in frequency between 7 and 6 or 8 is not very great. If you just do a few rolls, it would be very hard to predict with any certainty which one would win. It is only when you do a great many rolls that you can guarantee that 7 will win eventually.",
