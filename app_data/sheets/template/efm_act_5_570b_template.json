Use playing cards with picture cards removed or use Number Cards from 1 to 10. \n\nOn a turn, if you pick a 1 you can claim any odd number; if you pick any other number, you can claim any multiple of it. If you claim a number, your opponent cannot claim it. The aim is to make a path from one edge to the opposite edge, in either direction. You do not need to claim the squares in the order of your path. \n\nYou can either play that diagonal connections are okay or not okay. Another option is to include picture cards – if you get one of these, you can put in a blocked square that cannot be included in either person’s path.",
