If it is 1, you lose everything for that turn and the turn is over. A player may choose to stop before rolling a 1, keep the turn’s points so far, and add them to the player’s running total. The first player to reach the target number, say 30, wins.\n\nA two dice variation has these rules: If neither die shows a 1, the sum is added to the turn’s running total. If exactly one of the dice shows a 1, then nothing more is added to the running total and the turn ends. If two 1’s are rolled, the turn’s total becomes 0 and the turn ends.",
