The player could ask if the tens digit is bigger than or equal to the ones digit - it isnâ€™t for 23. The player could ask if the sum of the two digits is less than 8 - it is for 23. The player could then ask if twice the tens digit is bigger than the ones digit - it is. At this point, the number must be 23 or 34. Asking if the sum of the digits is less than 6 finishes things off.\n\nThe types of questions can be anything the players agree to, but it is best if the questions involve the ones and tens digits.",
