The player with the larger sum wins all four cards. If the sums are equal, the next two pairs of cards are added and the winner gets all eight cards. Play this with a single pass through the deck or multiple passes. Either way, the winner is the player who has the most cards. \n\nFor variety, play this using the difference of the two cards. Or, you can add three cards at a time. Another option is to assign one person to be Odd and the other Even. For this, each player turns over a card and the evenness or oddness of the sum determines who gets the cards.",
