          "value": "This game is lightly inspired by checkers. Each player has 10 counters. The counters are numbered from 1 to 10, with the “10” counter marked with 10 and 11. The counters start on the end rows of a 100-chart - one player on squares 1 to 10 and the other on squares 91 to 100.\n\nInitially, counters can only move “forward” one row onto any multiple of the number(s) on the marker they choose – for the player starting on 1 to 10, forward means larger numbers, and for the player starting on 91 to 100, forward means smaller numbers. Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can then move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it. A player’s piece cannot double up with another of the same player’s pieces. You win by taking all your opponent’s pieces. \n\nFor younger players, shorten the board to use the first 6 rows – the numbers from 1 to 60. A child who does not know all the multiples yet can use skip counting to figure out the moves.",
