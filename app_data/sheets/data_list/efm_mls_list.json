Eventually, they will put together the experiences from your words and start showing you that they understand them.\n\n**Expose, but do not rush:** Don't confuse early exposure with teaching. A child will put together the patterns from their experiences as they are developmentally ready. For example, you can't teach your child to count to 5 by explaining it to them – you can only expose them to your counting over and over again until it starts making sense to them. Never be impatient or push them to understand it more quickly – they have a lot to learn and they will naturally want to make sense of it all.\n\n**Searching game:** Make a game of searching for objects around where you are.

There are several things to work on at the same time, so it can be more complicated for your child than what you might think.\n\n* Counting forward and backward, including 0 sometimes \n* Learning the numbers\n* Learning quantities\n\n**Repeating the sequence:** At first, all your counting in front of your child will lead to your child starting to repeat the numbers in sequence. Don't be surprised if they leave out some of the numbers or they say the numbers in the wrong order. If they make these errors, don't make a big deal out of it; simply say the count correctly and move on. This is all part of the process and they will eventually learn the numbers in the correct order.\n\n**Count down sometimes:** Counting down will help your child understand the sequence. This helps keep it from being a meaningless sequence of sounds they make that makes adults happy. You can do this almost any time you would have counted up. For example, if you have three apples you want to remove, count down from three after you take away each apple.\n\n**Include 0 sometimes:** Start your counting at 0 sometimes to help 0 become an accepted number and quantity. You can also count down to 0. Counting down to 0 is great for events that are about to happen, say in ten seconds. You can count down to 0 and then say \"Blastoff\" or something similar.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive to an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things about counting and quantities. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when they count something they do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers they're saying. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally, they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Count everything:** There are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it out loud in front of your child, and be sure to count down sometimes and to include 0 sometimes."

Your child is learning several things. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when you count something you do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Mistakes:** There are many kinds of mistakes you should expect your child to make as they count. Your child may leave out numbers or they may leave out some of the numbers. Or they may get mixed up in doing 1-1 correspondence with a group of things they are counting. Your child will sort all this out with time.

Take time with it and reinforce the connection of each number with its corresponding quantity.\n\n**Reading numbers:** You may of course start introducing reading the numbers whenever you like.

A child who can count down will very quickly learn how to subtract 1 and 2. It is also helpful if counting down becomes automatic, so they can use their full attention on counting down the three steps when doing 9 subtract 3, for example.\n\n**Use when natural:** There are many times when counting down is the natural thing to do. If there are ten seconds left on a timer, you can count down together with the counter. If you say that something can be done three more times, then you can count down from three together.\n\n**Include 0:** It is usually natural to include 0 when counting down, and this is a good thing to do. If you are counting down the time remaining, when you reach 0 you have 0 seconds left. If you count down how many pieces of food your child can eat, when you reach 0 there will be no food left.

Create many, many experiences that allow your child to touch, feel, and directly experience the sizes of quanti- ties and how they compare.\n\n**Line them up:** One simple way to compare the sizes of two quantities is to line them up in 1-to-1 correspondence next to each other. For example, if you play a card game and you want to see who won, you can line up the cards of the two players and see which line has extra cards.\n\n**Common misunderstanding:** Be aware that a small child may think that two short sticks is the same amount as one long stick. This is perfectly understandable, but it is often not what the adult had in mind.\n\n**Give choices:** Put your child in situations where they can choose between two groups of of the same things they really like. When they pick the bigger group, reinforce it by saying that the chosen group had more than the other group.\n\n**Games:** You may be able to start playing simple card games, such as the game of \"War.\" Use the dots on the cards to allow your child to compare the quantities. Another good game to practice with is \"I'm Thinking of a Number,\" where you have a number line of cards with something hidden under one of the cards.\n\n**Number lines:** Number lines are an excellent visual aid for seeing which numbers are smaller (the ones on the left) and which are larger (the ones on the right). This is a good thing to expose your child to from an early age, but be aware that both the numerals and their being in a line is fairly abstract, so it will be a while before they understand what is going on with this picture that has numbers."

Create many, many experiences that allow your child to touch, feel, and directly experience the sizes of quanti- ties and how they compare.\n\n**Line them up:** One simple way to compare the sizes of two quantities is to line them up in 1-to-1 correspondence next to each other. For example, if you play a card game and you want to see who won, you can line up the cards of the two players and see which line has extra cards.\n\n**Common misunderstanding:** Be aware that a small child may think that two short sticks is the same amount as one long stick. This is perfectly understandable, but it is often not what the adult had in mind.\n\n**Give choices:** Put your child in situations where they can choose between two groups of of the same things they really like. When they pick the bigger group, reinforce it by saying that the chosen group had more than the other group.\n\n**Games:** You may be able to start playing simple card games, such as the game of \"War.\" Use the dots on the cards to allow your child to compare the quantities. Another good game to practice with is \"I'm Thinking of a Number,\" where you have a number line of cards with something hidden under one of the cards.\n\n**Number lines:** Number lines are an excellent visual aid for seeing which numbers are smaller (the ones on the left) and which are larger (the ones on the right). This is a good thing to expose your child to from an early age, but be aware that both the numerals and their being in a line is fairly abstract, so it will be a while before they understand what is going on with this picture that has numbers."

As your child gets comfortable with seeing a group of objects as a quantity, start doing Counting On in front of them to help them get the idea of it.\n\n**Example:** Suppose your child has one row of 3 cards and another row of 4 cards. They can count all the cards one at a time \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\" and see that there are 7 cards. However, if your child recognizes that there are three cards in one row, they don't need to count those cards. They can start their counting at 3, pointing to the three cards on the first row, and then count the second row \"4, 5, 6, 7.\" Your child is Counting On starting at 3, and that's where the name comes from.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** Being able to Count On saves time and effort. It also signals that your child is getting comfortable seeing the quantity associated with a group of objects and can work with them as a group. This is a big conceptual leap that will be very useful to them in all the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing soon to come.\n\n**Connection with addition:** Beginning addition is strongly linked to counting. When given a card with three dots on it, and another card with four dots on it, a child asked to add these two quan- tities will count them from 1 to 7. It is faster and more powerful to do this adding of 3 and 4 by starting at 3, or 4, and counting on using the other number. You will see finger techniques for doing this in upcoming lessons."

If they were asked to add two things to three things, that was done by counting all five things. As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things. This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Using fingers:** Children of this age will benefit greatly from having manipulatives to use when doing addition. It helps cement their understanding of the numbers in terms of quantities. Of course, the manipulative that is always available to them is their fingers. When doing our example of adding two to three, they can put up two fingers on one hand, three fingers on the other hand, and bring the two hands together. Another way to do it is to raise two fingers on one hand, raise three more fingers on that same hand, and then see a total of five fingers raised.\n\n**Add 0 sometimes:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually for your child.\n\n**Subtracting up to 5:** The ideas behind practicing subtraction are similar to those for addition. If your child is going to subtract three from five, have your chid raise five fingers and then lower three of them. Their familiarity with one less and two less will probably make subtracting one and two very easy.\n\n**Subtract 0 and everything sometimes:** Mix in questions where you subtract 0 sometimes. Also mix in questions where you subtract everything. For example, if you have three bits of food and you eat all of them, how many do you have left?\n\n**Memorizing:** As you ask your child to do various adding and subtracting problems that come along, your child will become more and more familiar with them and will eventually memorize them. While it is desirable to eventually make the recall of these facts automatic and easy for your child, there is no hurry.\n\n**Other math facts:** During this time your child's exposure to adding won't be restricted to those whose sum is 5 or less, and that is fine. For example, your child will probably have learned to add 1 or 2 to all the numbers up to 10. Your child may also have begun to learn the adding twin facts, such as 3 + 3 or 4 + 4."

Or, you can see the 3 blank squares and count this as 3 less than 10.\n\n**Be playful:** Play with all the different ways you and your child can do the counting. Seeing different ways to get the answer will open your child's eyes that math is about exploring and play, and not about arriving at an answer in some preferred way. All these different ways of counting will also develop a deeper understanding of quantities for your child.\n\n**Additive approaches:** One way to count up a group of objects is to add up the different parts of the group. That's what we did in this ten frame example when we added up 5 from the top row to the 2 in the bottom row.\n\n**Skip counting:** You may see a repeated pattern when you add up the parts of a group. That's what happened when we started by skip counting the two 2's on the left side.\n\n**Subtracting:** Another common technique is to subtract off what is missing from what would oth- erwise be a whole collection. That's what we did when we subtracted 3 from 10 in this example."

Once your child knows their adding twins, near twins is an easy next step. Think of 3 + 4 as 3 + 3 + 1, so it is 1 more than 3 + 3. So, 3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7. Alternatively, think of 3 + 4 as (4 - 1) + 3, which is 1 less than 4 + 4. So, 3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7. Allow your child to pick whichever approach they prefer for each near twin, or have fun doing them both ways.\n\nThis technique of using a familiar math fact to figure out a closely related math fact is powerful. It will help with learning many math facts in the months to come. Take your time and make sure your child thoroughly understands how this works. To explain it, demonstrate how 3 objects and 4 objects can be split up as 3 objects plus 3 objects plus one more – being able to see and touch things at this age is very powerful."

However, it uses interesting new wording that your child will need to get used to. When you first introduce the phrase of multiplying by 2, be sure to mix in the use of doubling from time to time to help with the transition. Your child will be getting used to the new words \"multiplying\" and \"times.\"\n\n**Half of something:** When something is doubled, such as 3 doubled is 6, then you can take half of the result and get back the original number. For example, suppose you picture 3 doubled as two rows of 3 things. Then taking half of those two matched rows is to take one of the rows, which is 3 things.\n\n**Equal sharing:** When you talk about taking half of something, you can combine that with the idea of sharing it equally among two people. If two people are to get equal shares, they will each get the same thing and that will be half of the original amount.\n\n**Dividing by 2:** If your child is comfortable with all the concepts so far in this learning step, then they are ready to talk about dividing! You can start talking about dividing something equally, or dividing it in two, or dividing by two. Mix together using all these phrases with your child – it will take time for them to absorb this new vocabulary. As far as the math is concerned, they have mastered all the ideas already!\n\n**Concrete examples:** Do lots of practice with each of these new ideas and words with groups of objects. Make your child's understanding be concrete rather than simply abstract. Anytime there is something to share among two people is a perfect time to practice. You can of course start extending this to sharing among more than two people if you like.\n\n**The beginning of multiplying and dividing:** As you have seen, this is the starting point of multi- plying and dividing.

Gather together 100 of these objects and put them in a big pile off to the side. As your child counts up from one, pull over one object at a time with each number and include it in the current group of objects.

Doing two-digit addition and subtraction requires fluency with the concepts of place value. Develop that understanding through lots of experiences with physical objects and written numbers.\n\n**Bundles of tens:** Take something you have lots of, make a large pile of it, and put some of them in a few bundles of ten. For example, out of that large pile ask your child to gather 23 of them. Then ask your child to group them in groups of ten. They will form two groups of ten and 3 singles. See what happens with the groups of ten in these 23 things as you put in some additional items or take some away, always making sure that there are no more than 9 single items at any time.\n\n**Expanded form:** The expanded form of a number is writing it as a sum of its place value parts. For example, 23 would be written as 20 + 3, and 256 would be written as 200 + 50 + 6. Practice with your child converting in both directions between a number's usual form and its expanded form. Point out that the expanded form of a number is the same as taking that many things and bundling them into groups of ten and have ones left over.\n\n**Counting with tick marks:** Counting using groups of five tick marks is a natural thing people like to do and is strongly related to place value. If you are counting 23 things with tick marks, you will end up with 4 bundles of 5 and 3 tick marks left over. Those 4 bundles of 5 can be reorganized as 2 bundles of 2 groups of 5, which is our expanded form view of 23.\n\n**Skip counting:** Skip counting by various numbers is a way to build mental practice with adding or subtracting single-digit and double-digit numbers. Although it is a great way to practice, this does require some mental steps that not every child will be ready for at this point – there is no hurry. Here are two examples. With lots of practice, these thinking steps will become automatic.\n\nSkip count upward by 8 starting at 23. Think of 23 as 20 plus 3 more. Using the number bonds for 10, 3 will need 7 more to make a group of 10. Use 7 out of the 8 being added so that 3 plus 7 forms another group of 10. So, 23 + 8 becomes 20 + 10 + 1, which is 31.\n\nSkip count downward by 5 starting at 23. Break up 5 into 3 and 2. To subtract 5, we will first take away 3 and then take away 2. 23 subtract 3 brings us to 20, which we will think of as 10 + 10. Subtracting the remaining 2 from one of those 10's leaves 8, so our answer is 10 + 8, which is 18."

Start with no fingers raised and both hands in a closed fist. Your child is going to count starting at 8, and each time a new number is mentioned, your child will raise another finger.

Understanding it also increases number sense for addition and subtraction. It is simpler than it sounds.\n\nFor example, suppose you were adding 99 + 15. You would recognize that 99 needs just one more to make 100, a number that is much easier to work with than 99. So you would move 1 from the 15 to the 99 – you would have the same total number of things, but they are distributed in a way that's easier to work with. This problem becomes 100 + 14, which is very easy to do. This is the kind of thing we'll be doing.\n\n**Compensation for addition:** The idea is to give or take some small amount to make one of the numbers easier to work with. We will typically be making one of the numbers into a multiple of 10. Suppose you are adding 8 + 7. The 8 just needs 2 more to become 10, so take that 2 away from the 7. This makes 8 + 7 into 10 + 5, which is easy. We could also have done this problem by giving 3 to the 7 to make it 10. In that case, we'd turn 8 + 7 into 5 + 10.\n\n**More compensation for addition:** There are other possibilities for using compensation in addition problems. Consider 6 + 8 for example. The 6 could give 2 to the 8 to make this problem 4 + 10. However, the 8 could give 1 to the 6 to make this 7 + 7, an adding twins problem. Challenge each other to think of different ways for doing a given adding problem.\n\n**Compensation for subtraction:** For subtraction, we will add the same amount or subtract the same amount from both numbers. This will keep the distance between them the same but will make them easier to work with. Typically that will mean turning the number we're subtracting into a multiple of 10. Suppose we are subtracting 13 - 8. If we add 2 to both numbers, then the distance between stays the same, but now we are subtracting 15 - 10, which is easy.

In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving.\n\n**An introduction to Nim:** Now that your child has been playing strategy games for a while, it is time to look into how to get more out of them. Let's use the game of Nim as an example. This game has some very simple rules: Pick a starting number, say 10, and a person to go first. Players alternate turns choosing to subtract 1 or 2 from the running total. The person who reaches 0 wins. The arithmetic is simple enough, but the strategy is challenging.\n\n**Learning from experience:** If you imagine you are playing any game against an extremely capable opponent, the game becomes a puzzle. How can I find the move that let's me have my best chance of winning no matter how well my opponent plays? One strategy is to play the game many times and pay attention to what seems to work and what doesn't. This approach is a good start and it does provide the opportunity for observation and insights. This can be a slow method of learning, and it may be very hard to find patterns in complicated games – imagine all the possibilities if we picked the starting number of 100 for Nim!\n\n**Solving Nim:** Can we look ahead a few moves and figure out good moves that way? That is hard to do starting at 10. If we start at 5, it's pretty easy to do. If we subtract 2, the new number will be 3. No matter whether the other play subtracts 1 or 2 at this point, we will win. So, if we are at the number 5, we know how to win. What happens with other small starting numbers? Can we find a pattern that will tell us which starting numbers will be winners and which will be losers? Can we explain why that pattern is true?\n\n**The goal:** If we follow this line of attack, we will completely solve how to play the game of Nim. What worked for Nim may or may not work for another game. This is problem solving, and each new problem can bring fresh challenges and a need for new ideas. And that is the fun. Share this attitude of puzzling and being challenged to your child. As they play a strategy game, discuss with them their ideas about what would make for a better or worse move at that moment. The point isn't so much to find the perfect move as it is to enjoy looking for it and having a discussion about it with people who they can enjoy sharing ideas with."

These games have a lot to offer children mathematically, even when there is no explicit numerical content.

One of the best ways to practice adding or subtracting a single-digit number with a double-digit number is to do skip counting using various skip sizes, going up or down, and starting at any number. The following methods for two two-digit numbers will of course work when one of the numbers is a single-digit number.\n\n**Use objects:** Grounding your child's understanding by using physical objects is always a good idea. Start by representing both of the numbers with groups of tens and ones.\n\n**Adding:** If you are adding the two numbers, put all the groups together and discuss the result. If you are adding two numbers, such as 23 and 45, that is all you need to do. However, if you are adding 23 and 48, the two groups of ones form at least a group of ten. Talk about how that changes the total number of tens you have from 6 to 7. This is called regrouping.\n\n**Subtracting:** If you are subtracting, start by removing the tens being subtracted from the bigger number and then attempt to remove the appropriate number of ones. For example, if you are subtracting 23 from 45, then there are enough ones and you are done. If there are not enough ones, such as if you are subtracting 28 from 45, then discuss how one of the groups of tens needs to be broken up and included with the ones. The original grouping of 45 as 4 tens and 5 ones becomes a grouping of 3 tens and 15 ones. This is also called regrouping.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Use objects for double-digit adding and subtracting until your child thoroughly understands the process and why regrouping makes sense when it is needed. At this point, move to representing the adding and subtracting with numbers written in expanded form. When working with numbers in expanded form, the process and the steps are exactly the same as they were when you were working with groups of tens and ones – and that is the point.\n\n**Making it automatic:** Over time and with lots of practice, your child will stop needing to use groups of tens and ones or expanded form. However, as with so many other things, there is no hurry getting to that point – it will come with practice."

          "eng": "**Divisors and factors:** If a number evenly divides into a number, then it is called a divisor of it. For example, 3 is a divisor of 6 because 3 divides into 6 exactly 2 times. 4 is not a divisor by 6 because it goes into it 1 1/2 times. The word factor means the same thing as divisor.\n\n**Common divisors:** In some mathematical situations, particularly with simplifying fractions, it is useful to find numbers that evenly divide two given numbers. Such numbers are called common divisors or common factors. The common divisors of 20 and 8 are 1, 2, and 4. You may enjoy exploring together why all the common divisors for a pair of numbers are divisors of the greatest of the common divisors.\n\n**Multiples:** A multiple of a number is anything that can be produced by multiplying the number by a whole number. For example, some multiples of 6 are 0, 6, 12, and 18. Notice that any multiple of a number has that number as a divisor. For example, each of the multiples of 6 has 6 as a divisor.\n\n**Common multiples:** A number which is a multiple of two given numbers is said to be a common multiple for them. Some common multiples of 6 and 4 are 0, 12, 24, and 36. Notice that all the common multiples are multiples of the least of the positive common multiples. Common multiples will be useful in adding and subtracting fractions.\n\n**Introduce these words:** Slowly introduce these new words to your child as you discuss situations that involve multiplication and division. They are useful words that simplify many discussions once the words are understood."

A prime number is a number larger than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and itself. The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are the first few prime numbers.\n\n**Composites and 1:** There are three kinds of positive whole numbers: 1 (which is called a unit), primes, and composites. Composites can be thought of as being constructed from primes. For example, 12 is 2 times 2 times 3. Every number larger than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely written as a product of two or more primes.\n\n**Prime factorizations:** Getting to know prime factorizations really well will be very helpful for many parts of the math your child is about to learn. Repeating the prime factorizations of the numbers up to 20, or even 30, is a good exercize for getting to know these factorizations. Simply go through the list of numbers in order like this: 1 - unit, 2 - prime, 3 - prime, 4 - 2 times 2, 5 - prime, 6 - 2 times 3, 7 - prime, 8 - 2 times 2 times 2, 9 - 3 times 3, and 10 - 2 times 5.\n\n**Powers:** Prime factorizations often involve repeated prime factors, so this is a good time to learn about powers and to practice them. It is quicker and easier to understand to say \"2 to the fourth\" than it is to say \"2 times 2 times 2 times 2.\" 2 squared means 2 times 2, and 2 cubed means 2 times 2 times 2."

The area of this rectangle is 12, which is 3 times 4 or 4 times 3 – its width times its length. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of width 3, the length must be 4. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of length 4, its width must be 3.

If we then take 12 and divide it by 4, the result is back to 3. Multiplying by 4 and then dividing by 4 gets back to where we started.\n\nSimilarly, if we take 12 and divide by 4 the answer is 3.

All those skills should be well mastered and understood before starting in on general single-digit division.\n\n**No remainder:** Division problems where the divisor goes in evenly without a remainder are mostly done by your child recognizing the corresponding multiplication fact. For example, if they are asked to divide 36 by 4, then remembering that 4 times 9 is 36 will get them straight to the answer. However, if that method doesn't work for a given problem, then they should use the next method.\n\n**Guessing and skip counting:** Suppose your child is asked to divide 29 by 4. Your child will not find 29 among their multiplication facts involving 4, so they will want to find a result that is less than 29 that does work. Have your child guess at a multiple of 4 that is less than 29. They might guess 24, which is 4 times 6. They can then skip count forward until they bump into 29. In this case that will mean moving forward to 28, which is 4 times 7. Seeing that they have to stop there, they have their answer that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n\n**Checking the answer:** Checking their answers is a good habit for your child to develop. In this last example, we think we found that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1. Check this by multiplying 4 times 7 to get 28, and then adding 1 to get 29. So it all checks out!"
