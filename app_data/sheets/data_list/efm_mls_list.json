Math Talk – Early and Often** Constantly pointing at and describing things is very important for a child's development. Start doing this long before they seem to understand.\n**2. Math Talk – At Home** There are many mathematical things in your home to talk about.\n**3. Math Talk – Out and About** Talk about math in a store, in the park, and in many other places. Math is all around us!\n**4. Math Talk – Describe, Compare** Use describing, comparison, and spatial relationship words with your child - this is math!\n**5. Math Talk – Counting** Whenever possible, count things for your child.\n**6. Math Talk – Point, Describe, and Ask** Begin asking questions that they can respond nonverbally to by pointing or actions.\n**7.

Don't be surprised if they leave out some of the numbers or they say the numbers in the wrong order. If they make these errors, don't make a big deal out of it; simply say the count correctly and move on. This is all part of the process and they will eventually learn the numbers in the correct order.\n\n**Count down sometimes:** Counting down will help your child understand the sequence. This helps keep it from being a meaningless sequence of sounds they make that makes adults happy. You can do this almost any time you would have counted up. For example, if you have three apples you want to remove, count down from three after you take away each apple.\n\n**Include 0 sometimes:** Start your counting at 0 sometimes to help 0 become an accepted number and quantity. You can also count down to 0. Counting down to 0 is great for events that are about to happen, say in ten seconds. You can count down to 0 and then say \"Blastoff\" or something similar.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive to an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things about counting and quantities. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when they count something they do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers they're saying. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally, they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Count everything:** There are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it out loud in front of your child, and be sure to count down sometimes and to include 0 sometimes."

Count things in front of your child and also count with your child when your child wants to. Counting is the foundation of understanding quantities.

Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it with your child, and be sure to include 0 as a starting point sometimes.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive for an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4,\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when you count something you do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n\n**Mistakes:** There are many kinds of mistakes you should expect your child to make as they count. Your child may leave out numbers or they may leave out some of the numbers. Or they may get mixed up in doing 1-1 correspondence with a group of things they are counting. Your child will sort all this out with time. For now, when your child makes a mistake, simply count the things out in front of them correctly and move on to something else.\n\n**Understand the numbers:** Don't be in such a hurry for your child to repeat the numbers 1 to 10 that they have no idea what they are saying. Take time with it and reinforce the connection of each number with its corresponding quantity.\n\n**Reading numbers:** You may of course start introducing reading the numbers whenever you like. However, don't let the reading limit the counting. Learning to read numerals will typically take longer than learning to say the numbers and getting a sense of the quantities."

          "eng": "**It helps with meaning:** Counting down is surprisingly effective at solidifying understanding of the number sequence. Many very young children who have learned to count from 1 to 10 have a difficult time when they first try to count from 10 down to 1. This counting in the opposite order forces them to think in a fresh way about how the numbers are ordered. This will be particularly true when your child starts counting to 100 and they start thinking about what happens as they go from one decade to the next – say between 69 and 70.\n\n**It helps with subtraction:** Counting down is also very helpful with learning to subtract. A child who can count down will very quickly learn how to subtract 1 and 2. It is also helpful if counting down becomes automatic, so they can use their full attention on counting down the three steps when doing 9 subtract 3, for example.\n\n**Use when natural:** There are many times when counting down is the natural thing to do. If there are ten seconds left on a timer, you can count down together with the counter. If you say that something can be done three more times, then you can count down from three together.\n\n**Include 0:** It is usually natural to include 0 when counting down, and this is a good thing to do. If you are counting down the time remaining, when you reach 0 you have 0 seconds left. If you count down how many pieces of food your child can eat, when you reach 0 there will be no food left. It is helpful to make 0 a normal and expected quantity to work with."

As your child gets comfortable with seeing a group of objects as a quantity, start doing Counting On in front of them to help them get the idea of it.\n\n**Example:** Suppose your child has one row of 3 cards and another row of 4 cards. They can count all the cards one at a time \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\" and see that there are 7 cards. However, if your child recognizes that there are three cards in one row, they don't need to count those cards. They can start their counting at 3, pointing to the three cards on the first row, and then count the second row \"4, 5, 6, 7.\" Your child is Counting On starting at 3, and that's where the name comes from.\n\n**Understanding quantities:** Being able to Count On saves time and effort. It also signals that your child is getting comfortable seeing the quantity associated with a group of objects and can work with them as a group. This is a big conceptual leap that will be very useful to them in all the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing soon to come.\n\n**Connection with addition:** Beginning addition is strongly linked to counting. When given a card with three dots on it, and another card with four dots on it, a child asked to add these two quan- tities will count them from 1 to 7. It is faster and more powerful to do this adding of 3 and 4 by starting at 3, or 4, and counting on using the other number. You will see finger techniques for doing this in upcoming lessons."

If they were asked to add two things to three things, that was done by counting all five things. As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things. This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Using fingers:** Children of this age will benefit greatly from having manipulatives to use when doing addition. It helps cement their understanding of the numbers in terms of quantities. Of course, the manipulative that is always available to them is their fingers. When doing our example of adding two to three, they can put up two fingers on one hand, three fingers on the other hand, and bring the two hands together. Another way to do it is to raise two fingers on one hand, raise three more fingers on that same hand, and then see a total of five fingers raised.\n\n**Add 0 sometimes:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually for your child.\n\n**Subtracting up to 5:** The ideas behind practicing subtraction are similar to those for addition. If your child is going to subtract three from five, have your chid raise five fingers and then lower three of them. Their familiarity with one less and two less will probably make subtracting one and two very easy.\n\n**Subtract 0 and everything sometimes:** Mix in questions where you subtract 0 sometimes. Also mix in questions where you subtract everything. For example, if you have three bits of food and you eat all of them, how many do you have left?\n\n**Memorizing:** As you ask your child to do various adding and subtracting problems that come along, your child will become more and more familiar with them and will eventually memorize them. While it is desirable to eventually make the recall of these facts automatic and easy for your child, there is no hurry.\n\n**Other math facts:** During this time your child's exposure to adding won't be restricted to those whose sum is 5 or less, and that is fine. For example, your child will probably have learned to add 1 or 2 to all the numbers up to 10. Your child may also have begun to learn the adding twin facts, such as 3 + 3 or 4 + 4."

They are useful for getting familiar with quantities up to 10 as well as seeing pairs of numbers that add up to 10 – the filled squares plus the unfilled ones will always add up to 10.",
      "block5_text": "**Flash numbers:** A fun activity with your child is to flash a partially filled ten frame or a group of fingers on your two hands, and then have your child quickly recognize the quantity of things. If you use five or more fingers, put up five of those fingers on one hand so the two hands look like a ten frame. This activity also lays the groundwork for more easily using quantities on two hands for adding and subtracting.\n\n**Finger adding to 10:** If both numbers are five or less, put up the appropriate number of fingers on the two hands and count them up. Alternatively, put up the number of fingers for one of the numbers, and then count that many more fingers for the other number. When you are done, the total number of fingers shown will be the sum.\n\n**Finger subtracting to 10:** Do subtracting from numbers that are ten or less by putting up the number of fingers for the number being subtracted from. Then put down one finger at a time as you count up the number that is being subtracted. The resulting number of fingers left up is the answer."

Ten frames are designed to help visualize number bonds for 10. A ten frame with 7 dots in it makes it visually obvious that 7 + 3 is a number bond for 10.\n\n**Games and puzzles:** There are quite a few games and puzzles that involve number bonds. Sum Groups is a puzzle designed to practice number bonds. Many games, such as Memory Challenge and Go Fish, have versions that use target totals and thereby exercise number bonds."

When you first introduce the phrase of multiplying by 2, be sure to mix in the use of doubling from time to time to help with the transition. Your child will be getting used to the new words \"multiplying\" and \"times.\"\n\n**Half of something:** When something is doubled, such as 3 doubled is 6, then you can take half of the result and get back the original number. For example, suppose you picture 3 doubled as two rows of 3 things. Then taking half of those two matched rows is to take one of the rows, which is 3 things.\n\n**Equal sharing:** When you talk about taking half of something, you can combine that with the idea of sharing it equally among two people. If two people are to get equal shares, they will each get the same thing and that will be half of the original amount.\n\n**Dividing by 2:** If your child is comfortable with all the concepts so far in this learning step, then they are ready to talk about dividing! You can start talking about dividing something equally, or dividing it in two, or dividing by two. Mix together using all these phrases with your child – it will take time for them to absorb this new vocabulary. As far as the math is concerned, they have mastered all the ideas already!\n\n**Concrete examples:** Do lots of practice with each of these new ideas and words with groups of objects. Make your child's understanding be concrete rather than simply abstract. Anytime there is something to share among two people is a perfect time to practice. You can of course start extending this to sharing among more than two people if you like.\n\n**The beginning of multiplying and dividing:** As you have seen, this is the starting point of multi- plying and dividing. There are one or two new ideas, and a lot of new vocabulary. It's exciting to see your child step into this new part of the world!"

Once your child knows the sequence of the 10's, it is usually very easy for them to fill in the changes in 1's. For example, they will quickly learn to count \"70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.\"\n\n**Skip count by 10's:** When your child gets stuck counting between 1 and 100, it is usually at a transition in 10's. Typical questions to help your child get unstuck are: \"What comes next after the 60's?\" or \"What comes before the 50's?\" Practice skip counting by 10's to help with this. If your child can produce the 10's from 0 to 100 forward and backward, then they will be ready to answer those questions about which 10's come next or before.\n\n**Use objects:** Make this counting have more meaning by practicing it using a large group of small objects, such as pebbles. Gather together 100 of these objects and put them in a big pile off to the side. As your child counts up from one, pull over one object at a time with each number and include it in the current group of objects. Each time a group of ten objects is formed, put that group together in a special tens area. As the numbers increase, the tens area will have more and more groups of tens. By the time your child is in the 50's, there should be five groups of ten and a small collection of left over ones.\n\nYou can also do this practice in reverse by starting with ten groups of tens and then taking away one at a time as your child counts down from 100.\n\n**Count both directions:** Children often become really good counting quickly and automatically upward from 1 to 100, but then have trouble counting in the opposite direction. Counting from 100 to 1 forces more thought about the 10's transitions and helps with understanding the numbers better in general.\n\n**100 number chart:** Having a ten by ten 100 number chart going from 1 to 100, or from 0 to 99, will help your child see the pattern of the numbers. It will make it particularly clear how the tens place stays the same for ten numbers and the ones place keeps changing."

Doing two-digit addition and subtraction requires fluency with the concepts of place value. Develop that understanding through lots of experiences with physical objects and written numbers.\n\n**Bundles of tens:** Take something you have lots of, make a large pile of it, and put some of them in a few bundles of ten. For example, out of that large pile ask your child to gather 23 of them. Then ask your child to group them in groups of ten. They will form two groups of ten and 3 singles. See what happens with the groups of ten in these 23 things as you put in some additional items or take some away, always making sure that there are no more than 9 single items at any time.\n\n**Expanded form:** The expanded form of a number is writing it as a sum of its place value parts. For example, 23 would be written as 20 + 3, and 256 would be written as 200 + 50 + 6. Practice with your child converting in both directions between a number's usual form and its expanded form. Point out that the expanded form of a number is the same as taking that many things and bundling them into groups of ten and have ones left over.\n\n**Counting with tick marks:** Counting using groups of five tick marks is a natural thing people like to do and is strongly related to place value. If you are counting 23 things with tick marks, you will end up with 4 bundles of 5 and 3 tick marks left over. Those 4 bundles of 5 can be reorganized as 2 bundles of 2 groups of 5, which is our expanded form view of 23.\n\n**Skip counting:** Skip counting by various numbers is a way to build mental practice with adding or subtracting single-digit and double-digit numbers. Although it is a great way to practice, this does require some mental steps that not every child will be ready for at this point – there is no hurry. Here are two examples. With lots of practice, these thinking steps will become automatic.\n\nSkip count upward by 8 starting at 23. Think of 23 as 20 plus 3 more. Using the number bonds for 10, 3 will need 7 more to make a group of 10. Use 7 out of the 8 being added so that 3 plus 7 forms another group of 10. So, 23 + 8 becomes 20 + 10 + 1, which is 31.\n\nSkip count downward by 5 starting at 23. Break up 5 into 3 and 2. To subtract 5, we will first take away 3 and then take away 2. 23 subtract 3 brings us to 20, which we will think of as 10 + 10. Subtracting the remaining 2 from one of those 10's leaves 8, so our answer is 10 + 8, which is 18."

The number bond for 10 using 7 is 3, so your child can use 3 of the 5 to get to 10. The remaining 2 of the 5 will bring the total to 12. The point was to break up the 5 into two pieces, 3 and 2 – one which got the 7 to 10, and the other gets added onto the 10. This problem could also have been done the other way. The 7 could have been broken up into 5 and 2 – the 5 would be added to the original 5 to get 10, and then the 2 would be added to 10 to get 12.\n\nNotice that this is similar to the thinking for doing addition compensation.\n\n**Subtracting from a number bigger than 10:** Let's use 12 - 7 as our example. We can do this as a take away or a difference problem.\n\nAs a take away problem, we'll use 2 of the 7 to get 12 down to 10. We then have 5 of the 7 left to take the 10 down to 5. We broke 7 into 2 and 5 to be able to use 10 as an intermediate stop along the way.\n\nAs a difference problem, the total distance between 12 and 7 is the distance between 12 and 10 plus the distance between 10 and 7. The distance between 12 and 10 is 2, and the distance from 10 and 7 is 3, so the total distance is 2 plus 3, which is 5."

Let's use the game of Nim as an example. This game has some very simple rules: Pick a starting number, say 10, and a person to go first. Players alternate turns choosing to subtract 1 or 2 from the running total. The person who reaches 0 wins. The arithmetic is simple enough, but the strategy is challenging.\n\n**Learning from experience:** If you imagine you are playing any game against an extremely capable opponent, the game becomes a puzzle. How can I find the move that let's me have my best chance of winning no matter how well my opponent plays? One strategy is to play the game many times and pay attention to what seems to work and what doesn't. This approach is a good start and it does provide the opportunity for observation and insights. This can be a slow method of learning, and it may be very hard to find patterns in complicated games – imagine all the possibilities if we picked the starting number of 100 for Nim!\n\n**Solving Nim:** Can we look ahead a few moves and figure out good moves that way? That is hard to do starting at 10. If we start at 5, it's pretty easy to do. If we subtract 2, the new number will be 3. No matter whether the other play subtracts 1 or 2 at this point, we will win. So, if we are at the number 5, we know how to win. What happens with other small starting numbers? Can we find a pattern that will tell us which starting numbers will be winners and which will be losers? Can we explain why that pattern is true?\n\n**The goal:** If we follow this line of attack, we will completely solve how to play the game of Nim. What worked for Nim may or may not work for another game. This is problem solving, and each new problem can bring fresh challenges and a need for new ideas. And that is the fun. Share this attitude of puzzling and being challenged to your child. As they play a strategy game, discuss with them their ideas about what would make for a better or worse move at that moment. The point isn't so much to find the perfect move as it is to enjoy looking for it and having a discussion about it with people who they can enjoy sharing ideas with."

One of the best ways to practice adding or subtracting a single-digit number with a double-digit number is to do skip counting using various skip sizes, going up or down, and starting at any number. The following methods for two two-digit numbers will of course work when one of the numbers is a single-digit number.\n\n**Use objects:** Grounding your child's understanding by using physical objects is always a good idea. Start by representing both of the numbers with groups of tens and ones.\n\n**Adding:** If you are adding the two numbers, put all the groups together and discuss the result. If you are adding two numbers, such as 23 and 45, that is all you need to do. However, if you are adding 23 and 48, the two groups of ones form at least a group of ten. Talk about how that changes the total number of tens you have from 6 to 7. This is called regrouping.\n\n**Subtracting:** If you are subtracting, start by removing the tens being subtracted from the bigger number and then attempt to remove the appropriate number of ones. For example, if you are subtracting 23 from 45, then there are enough ones and you are done. If there are not enough ones, such as if you are subtracting 28 from 45, then discuss how one of the groups of tens needs to be broken up and included with the ones. The original grouping of 45 as 4 tens and 5 ones becomes a grouping of 3 tens and 15 ones. This is also called regrouping.\n\n**Use expanded form:** Use objects for double-digit adding and subtracting until your child thoroughly understands the process and why regrouping makes sense when it is needed. At this point, move to representing the adding and subtracting with numbers written in expanded form. When working with numbers in expanded form, the process and the steps are exactly the same as they were when you were working with groups of tens and ones – and that is the point.\n\n**Making it automatic:** Over time and with lots of practice, your child will stop needing to use groups of tens and ones or expanded form. However, as with so many other things, there is no hurry getting to that point – it will come with practice."

For example, 3 x 4 = 12, 4 x 3 = 12, 12 / 3 = 4, and 12 / 4 = 3 form a fact family.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing are related:** For the 3 x 4 = 12 fact family, visualize this interconnection using a rectangle that is 3 by 4. The area of this rectangle is 12, which is 3 times 4 or 4 times 3 – its width times its length. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of width 3, the length must be 4. To get an area of 12 for a rectangle of length 4, its width must be 3. All these facts are tied together.\n\n**Multiplying and dividing undo each other:** Let's continue to use the example of 3 times 4. If we start with 3 and multiply it by 4 we arrive at 12. If we then take 12 and divide it by 4, the result is back to 3. Multiplying by 4 and then dividing by 4 gets back to where we started.\n\nSimilarly, if we take 12 and divide by 4 the answer is 3. If we then multiply 3 by 4 the answer is 12, which is where we started. Dividing by 4 and then multiplying by 4 returns things to the beginning."

          "eng": "**You have prepared the way:** Your work with skip counting, learning multiplication facts, and fact families will smooth the way for dividing both with and without remainders. All those skills should be well mastered and understood before starting in on general single-digit division.\n\n**No remainder:** Division problems where the divisor goes in evenly without a remainder are mostly done by your child recognizing the corresponding multiplication fact. For example, if they are asked to divide 36 by 4, then remembering that 4 times 9 is 36 will get them straight to the answer. However, if that method doesn't work for a given problem, then they should use the next method.\n\n**Guessing and skip counting:** Suppose your child is asked to divide 29 by 4. Your child will not find 29 among their multiplication facts involving 4, so they will want to find a result that is less than 29 that does work. Have your child guess at a multiple of 4 that is less than 29. They might guess 24, which is 4 times 6. They can then skip count forward until they bump into 29. In this case that will mean moving forward to 28, which is 4 times 7. Seeing that they have to stop there, they have their answer that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n\n**Checking the answer:** Checking their answers is a good habit for your child to develop. In this last example, we think we found that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1. Check this by multiplying 4 times 7 to get 28, and then adding 1 to get 29. So it all checks out!"
