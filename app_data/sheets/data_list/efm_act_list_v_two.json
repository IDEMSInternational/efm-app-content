Count the number of raised fingers on your right hand, say 1. Bring the hands together and poof – the fingers on your right hand are transferred to the left – there are now 4 fingers raised. Magic!\n\nSummarize by saying '3 fingers plus 1 more finger creates 4 fingers. Tada!'\n\n**For subtraction:** Raise some fingers on your left hand, say 4 of them. Have your right hand reach over and grab some of the fingers, say 1 of them. Presto, there will be 3 fingers left raised on the left hand and 1 raised on the right hand. Summarize this saying that 4 take away 1 gives three, or say that you have broken 4 into two pieces which are 3 and 1. This wording emphasizes the concept of number bonds, which are pairs of numbers that add up to a given total.",

Deal a 3 by 4 grid of cards out on the table, all face-down.\n\n**How to play:** Players take turns flipping two cards face-up. If the two cards are ten apart, the player gets to keep the cards, replaces the two cards from the draw pile, and continues their turn. If the cards do not match, the player flips the cards back over and ends their turn.\n\n**How to win:** The game ends when the last pair of cards is taken. The player with the most cards wins."

Here are a few possibilities – have fun thinking of many more with your child.\n\n**Investigation 1:** Drawing with only red and blue, how many ways can you draw a monster with a hat, eyes, and cape? How does this change if you only colored the hat and the cape? How would it change if you used three colors, or if you could only use each color once?\n\n**Investigation 2:** You have a row of 5 identical candies. How many ways can you color them so that there are 2 red ones and 3 blue ones?\n\n**Investigation 3:** Find all the ways to get a sum using a small set of numbers. Do this with and without considering order. For example, if you use 1 and 2, there are 1+1+1+1 = 2+1+1 = 2+2 ways of getting 4 without considering order, and 1+1+1+1 = 2+1+1 = 1+2+1 = 1+1+2 = 2+2 ways of getting 4 considering order."

      "block3_text": "**How to play:** During a turn, a player draws a horizontal or vertical line connecting two unjoined adjacent dots. If the new line completes a 1 by 1 box, the player earns a point and draws another line.\n\n**How to win:** When no more lines can be drawn, the player with the most points wins. An easy way to keep track of points is to put an initial inside each earned box.",
      "block4_text": "Although this is traditionally played with little squares, it can also be played with dots in a pattern to produce triangles or hexagons – it’s just harder to draw."
