The Puzzler declares, “I am thinking of a number from 0 to 8” (for example). The Questioner then asks questions of the form “How does your number compare to 3?” The Puzzler answers that the number is smaller, equal to, or larger than that number.\n\n**Use cards:** With younger children, play this game with counting cards from 0 to 8 placed face up. Hide a star under one of the cards. After each guess, the Questioner turns over all the eliminated cards until the star is discovered.",
      "block3_text": "**Example:** The game pictured above uses cards with a target of 5.\n\nPuzzler: I’m thinking of a number from 0 to 8. \nQuestion: How does your number compare to 3? \nPuzzler: My number is larger than 3.\nQuestion: How does your number compare to 6? \nPuzzler: My number is smaller than 6.\nQuestion: How does your number compare to 5? \nPuzzler: Well done! My number is equal to 5."

After each roll, move the token for the sum of the dice one square to the right. The goal for each token is to be the first to get all the way to the right across the page.\n\nLet your child come up with some questions to investigate. Some natural questions are:\n\n* Which token(s) will win and why?\n* Which tokens do well and which ones do poorly?\n* Which token is the worst?\n* How will the winners change if the row lengths are made shorter or longer?\n\nHave your child explain their ideas about the answers to these questions, and then investigate their ideas by running experiments.\n\nAdd a competitive element to this by guessing which token will win before the round starts."

Your child has also picked up skip counting by 2, doubling, halving, and even and odd numbers – all of which set the stage for learning multiplication and division.",
      "block2_accord": "New ideas for this stage",
      "block2_text": "* Counting to 100 – While it’s fun to hear your child count to 100, keep this practice grounded in understanding the numbers – place value and counting backwards will help a lot with this.\n* Expanded Form and Place Value – The earlier practice with this will be reinforced here. Understanding tens and ones, and using expanded form (such as 37 = 30 + 7), is essential to\nunderstanding numbers.\n* Comparing double-digit numbers – Understanding place value will make this easy.\n* All single-digit adding and subtracting – This is first done with manipulatives, especially fingers. Then, using number relationships, it will be extended to mental arithmetic.\n* Compensation for Addition and Subtraction – Adjusting addition and subtraction problems to make them easier helps with mental arithmetic, and teaches the structure of numbers.\n* Skip Counting – Skipping up and down by single-digit numbers starting anywhere is great for doing mental addition and subtraction, and helps with multiplication and division.\n* Beginning multiplying – Your child already knows how to multiply by 2. This will be extended, in part using skip counting, to all single-digit numbers.\n* Games, Puzzles, Problem Solving and Investigations – The games and puzzles will be more\nchallenging in keeping with your child’s growing sophistication and abilities. Keep these activities fun and playful - enjoyment is the most important thing for your child’s long term mathematical success. Kindle sparks of joy when your child discovers or experiences particularly beautiful or satisfying mathematical patterns."

Some rows or columns may not be marked – if so, there is no constraint on the product of those rows or columns."
