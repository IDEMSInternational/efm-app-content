The question is: If you randomly pick two cards and add them, are you more likely to get an even or odd number? Count how many ways there are of getting an odd number versus an even number. For example, in the case of using 1, 2, and 3, there is one way to get an even number (1 + 3) and two ways to get an odd number (1 + 2, 2 + 3). So the odd number sums are more likely (twice as likely).\n\n**Make it a contest:** Let one player be Even and the other player be Odd. See who has the most successes after a dozen trial runs."

Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can then move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it. A player’s piece cannot double up with another of the same player’s pieces.\n\n**How to win:** You win by taking all your opponent’s pieces."
