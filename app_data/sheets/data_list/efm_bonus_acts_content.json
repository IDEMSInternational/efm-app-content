The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty.

Despite that simple goal, you may start to wonder about deeper ideas in the puzzle.\n\nA frequent theme of problem solving is to learn from simpler problems or examples. So, let’s do that.\n\nThe smallest example is 2 by 2. For this size, it is clear that the rows will end up being either 1 2; 3 0 or 1 3; 2 0.\n\nThe next smallest is 2 by 3. Start this by getting the 1 and 4 in the left column. Once this is done, your puzzle will look like 1 _ _; 4 _ _ . Finish off the last four squares as you would the 2 by 2 case.\n\nThe 2 by 4 puzzle is done similarly. Start by putting 1 and 5 in the left column. Next, put the 2 and 6 in the second left column without disturbing the 1 and 4. Finally finish off the last 2 by 2.\n\nAt this point, the pattern for attacking puzzles with 2 rows is clear. What to do with more than 2 rows? Suppose you have 3 rows. Start the solution by getting the top row correctly laid out. After that, leave the top row undisturbed and use your ability to solve a puzzle with 2 rows.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 4 rows, do the top row first, the second row next (without disturbing the top row), and finish off the last 2 rows as before."

          "eng": "Okay, you have a simple method for solving the puzzle. The next question is: How can I just look at the puzzle and know whether it is solvable or not?\n\nTo make describing the answer as simple as possible, do a few quick moves, if needed, to place the empty square in the bottom row. Next, make a list of the rows in one long list - the first row is listed first, the second row is listed second, and so on with the last row listed last. Omit the empty square when you list the last row.\n\nTake this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n\nAs an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n\nWhy does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions."

Because the mirror image of any solution is easy to make and is also a solution, it makes sense to ignore those. Ignoring mirror images will reduce the number of solutions to consider by half. \n\nFor example, we can assume that not only is the 6 in the bottom row, but it is either in the middle or the right side of the bottom row. Continuing that thinking with the 5, the bottom row can only have four possible layouts: 5 a 6, b 5 6, c 1 6, or d 6 1.\n\nAt this point it is a matter of working through the various possible values of a, b, c, and d.

The 8 and 7 cards are also good cards to use to get rid of possibilities.\n\nThis means the bottom row looks like one of the following (ignoring mirror images): \n\na b 9 10;   c 9 d 10;   9 e f 10;   g h 10 9;   i 9 10 j;   9 k 10 L;   m n 1 10;   o 1 10 p;  q r 10 1\n\nThat is a lot of possibilities to consider!\n\nFortunately, if you consider where 8 and 7 can go, the possibilities are reduced to the following list (assuming there are no mistakes!). It is easy to finish each one of these after you have the bottom row.\n\n8 3 10 9;   6 1 10 8;   8 1 10 6\n\nPyramids of size 15, 21, or higher are left to the truly dedicated. Good luck and enjoy!"

The 6 must be in the bottom row because it cannot be the difference of any pair of numbers. Similarly, the 5 must either be in the bottom row or in the middle row above the 6 and the 1.",

      "block2_text": "If your child finds this puzzle easy to do, challenge them to find all the ways it can be done. Discuss what it means for two solutions to be different - if one solution is the mirror image of another, should it be considered different?\n\nAnswering the question of what makes solutions different is useful to do at the start. Because the mirror image of any solution is easy to make and is also a solution, it makes sense to ignore those. Ignoring mirror images will reduce the number of solutions to consider by half. \n\nFor example, we can assume that not only is the 6 in the bottom row, but it is either in the middle or the right side of the bottom row. Continuing that thinking with the 5, the bottom row can only have four possible layouts: 5 a 6, b 5 6, c 1 6, or d 6 1.\n\nAt this point it is a matter of working through the various possible values of a, b, c, and d. After some trial and error you will find that a is 2, b can never work, c must be 4, and d must be 4. So, ignoring mirror images, there are exactly three solutions:",

They do not yet have the math or reasoning skills to be systematic with their exploration. However, these puzzles can be explored more deeply, and here are some ideas to dig into if you or an older child are interested.\n\nLet SUM represent the sum of one side of the triangle. If you add up the three sides of the triangle, the total will be 3 x SUM. However, the total of the three sides will also be the sum of all the numbers plus one extra copy for each corner of the triangle. Let C-SUM be the sum of the values in the three corners.

This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n\nAnother thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values. What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n\nThe last thing to notice before we dig in with actual numbers is that for any solution for the three corners, we can assume that they are in increasing order going around clockwise, with the smallest number at the top. If they are not in that configuration to begin with, you can rotate or flip the diagram until they are.\n\nAll these observations save a tremendous amount of work.

If SUM is 10, then a + b + c = 3 x 10 - 21 = 9. This leaves two possibilities - either corner values of 1, 2, and 6, or 1, 3, and 5. A quick trial rules out 1, 2, and 6 as a possibility.\n\nAfter much work, we have the solutions for SUM being 9 and 10 for the six circle puzzle.

For example, 32 petals is four 7’s and one 4, and it is also eight 4’s.\n\nBy trying many pairs of numbers, there are lots of examples to play with. For some pairs of numbers there comes a point where all numbers of petals are possible, and for other pairs of numbers there is no such point. For 4 and 7, every number from 18 on is possible.

If your child wants to go up some steps, a natural question is: How many ways can this be done?\nFor example, for 0 steps there is just one way - you just stand there. For 1 step there is one way - you take a single step. For two steps, you can either take one double step or two single steps. \n\nYour child should carefully count many cases of this and make a table of the results. When there is lots of information, a table often helps organize the information and allow patterns to stand out. The table would look like this (okay, going beyond 6 may require too much patience, but here are the numbers):\n\n1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 21 - 34 - 55\n\nAfter looking at these numbers, your child may notice that each pair of consecutive numbers adds up to the next number. Why does this happen? These numbers are called Fibonacci Numbers. The rule for creating the official Fibonacci Numbers is that each number is the sum of the previous two. This also happens for the steps. Hmmm ...\n\nLet’s look closely at one example - say 5 steps. The 8 possibilities are: 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 2+2+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+2+2, and 2+1+2. The first 5 possibilities use 1 for the last move, and the last 3 possibilities use 2 for the last move. That explains it - you can go up 5 steps by either going up 4 steps and taking 1 more step, or by going up 3 steps and going up 2 more steps. The number of ways of going up 5 steps is exactly equal to the sum of the number of ways of going up 4 steps plus the number of ways of going up 3 steps.\n\nPatterns are often understood by patiently going through examples, organizing the data, looking closely at the data, and digging for explanations of why things happen the way they do.

The scale is usually supplied with a set of weights that are used to measure the weight of other objects. There are many interesting investigations you can do if you restrict the weights you are allowed to use.\n\n**One Kind of Weight** Suppose you have lots of weights, but they are all the same - say, 5 units. Then the only things you can weigh exactly are objects that are a multiple of 5 (just like skip counting by 5).\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - One Side** Suppose you have lots of weights that are either 4 units or 7 units and you only use them on one side of the balance. The things you can weigh are the same numbers you found in the flower petal investigation. For 4 and 7, starting at 18 units you can weigh everything exactly. If the weights are 4 units and 6 units, you can only weigh even numbers starting with 4.\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - Both Sides** After doing the investigation with two kinds of weights on one side, your child might be surprised if you ask them to weigh a 3-unit item, or even a 1-unit item, with 4’s and 7’s. The trick is to put some weights on one side and other weights on the other side. For example, verify an item weighs 3 units by putting it with a 4-unit weight and see that it balances with a 7-unit weight. Similarly, verify an item weighs 1 unit by putting it with a 7-unit weight and see that it balances with two 4-unit weights.\n\nThere is an important math theorem called Bezout’s Theorem hidden in this investigation. Your child doesn’t need to know about that theorem at this point, but isn’t it cool that a young child can be playing around with advanced mathematics!\n\n**Doubling Weights** What happens if you have one weight each for each of the weights in the doubling progression 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16? How many ways can you weigh something that weighs 13? What is the largest weight you can measure? \n\nAfter some investigation, you will find that you can weigh everything up to one less than double the highest weight - in this case that is 31. Also, each item you can weigh can only be weighed in one way - for example, 13 = 1 + 4 + 8, and there is no other way to do it. Pretty cool! This situation is related to the binary number system.\n\nFibonacci Weights: What happens if the weights are in the Fibonacci Numbers? Is there more than one way to weigh some weights?

With this, 10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 + 8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 1 + 8. What is causing the duplication is that the Fibonacci rule creates more than one way to write the Fibonacci numbers in terms of themselves - for example, 2 = 1 + 1 and 8 = 5 + 3. The way to fix this problem is to insist that you cannot use two Fibonacci numbers that are neighbors of each other in the sequence. When you add that restriction, the only way to get 10 is 2 + 8."

See if your child can come up with some of these questions - however, if they don’t arise naturally, here are some questions to ask.\n\na) Why are the numbers that drop down primes?\n\nSuppose you have a composite number. We want to show that this number will have an X under it. Being composite, it is divisible by some number, n, between 1 and that number. If n is a prime, then our composite number would have an X under it from n being an earlier prime. If n is not a prime, then it has an X under it from some earlier prime, call it p. Now, p evenly divides n and n evenly divides our new number, so p must divide our new number. Consequently, when marking the multiples of p, an X would have been placed under our new number.\n\nb) When you are placing X’s for the multiples of a prime, there are some numbers that already have an X from an earlier prime. When does that happen and when doesn’t it happen?\n\nLet’s look at the multiples of 5 in the sieve above. The multiples 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are already crossed out. Only 5 x 5 is new. This happens because 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are all multiples of 2 and 3, earlier primes. If we want to put X’s in fresh places, we must multiply 5 by numbers that only have prime factors that are 5 and above. Because it is a little tedious to keep track of all that, what some people do is only cross out odd multiples and leave it at that.\n\nc) For this sieve, what was the last prime that had a useful new X in its row?\n\nIn this sieve, the primes with useful X’s are 2, 3, and 5. The multiples of 7 and 11 were all old X’s. If you look at the answer to the last question, you will see the answer here. The only way to get new X’s is to multiply a prime by primes bigger than or equal to itself. Once we reach a prime like 7 where 7 x 7 > 25, we do not need to check it. So, we only need to check primes whose square is smaller than or equal to the last number.\n\nd) If you were given a number, say 53, which primes would you need to divide it by to see that it is prime? \n\nFrom the answer to the last question, we only need to check primes whose square is less than or equal to 53.

      "block1_text": "A rectangle, 4 by 4 or larger, with numbers in some of its squares,  is to be divided into smaller rectangles. Each number must end up  in a separate rectangle whose area is that number. \n\nFor adults, constructing these puzzles is simple enough. Take a rectangle, divide its interior into rectangles, put numbers for the areas inside each interior rectangle, and then remove any sign of the interior rectangles. The only tricky part is putting numbers in places that make the puzzle reasonably easy to solve - you can always give hints as needed if your puzzle ends up being too hard.",

      "block3_text": "a) Look at numbers with only one or two options for their rectangles.\n\nBoth 4’s are highly constrained. Each 4 can only be inside a 1 by 4 or a 2 by 2 rectangle. The upper 4 is hemmed in, so it cannot be inside a 1 by 4. So, there must be a 2 by 2 rectangle in the upper left corner. That leaves the lower 4 with only the possibility that its rectangle is 1 by 4 and goes along the bottom side.\n\nb) Look at prime numbers - they must be inside a 1 by n rectangle.\n\nThe 3’s in the puzzle above must be contained in a 1 by 3 rectangle. The 3 in the upper right corner can only be part of a 1 by 3 rectangle going along the top edge or along the right side. The upper left 2 by 2 square being blocked off for the 4 makes it impossible to have a 1 by 3 along the top edge. \n\nThe 1 by 4 along the bottom forces the 1 by 3 for the lower of the two 3’s to be the higher of the two vertical possibilities.",
      "block4_text": "c) Numbers close to the maximum dimension often have few options.\n\nLook at the 6’s and 5’s in this next puzzle. The uppermost 6 needs lots of room, and the only way there is enough room for it is vertically straight down, using up the entire column. The other 6 cannot be 1 x 6 because the row was cut off by the other 6’s column. So, the lower 6 must be a 2 x 3, which is not quite determined yet.\nAs another example, if there had been an 8 in this puzzle, 1 by 8 would not have fit, so it would have to be part of a 2 by 4 rectangle.\n\nd) Squares that are boxed in have few options.\n\nThe uppermost 5 is boxed in, so it’s only choice is to be in a 5-box column. The other 5, because it is also a prime, must go vertically or horizontally. It is cut off horizontally by the column for the 6, so it must go vertically up to right below the 3.\n\ne) Corners are often highly constrained.\n\nThe 2 in the upper right corner must go horizontally, so it is easy to fill in."

If you remove one corner of the chessboard, you know immediately that you can no longer cover the chessboard with tiles because the tiles will always cover an even number of squares, and there are now 63 squares to cover. Okay, remove two corners to make an even number of remaining squares - can you cover it now? The answer depends on which two corners you remove. Why?

Not only will k tiles cover 2xk squares, but they will cover k white squares and k black squares - the same number of squares of each color. Using this idea, it becomes obvious that if you remove more squares of one color than another, it will be impossible to cover the board. \n\nIf your child is enjoying these questions, start branching out to using other shapes to fill the board.

Also, if you know a number is possible, is there an easy way to describe how to do it?\n\nLet your child play with it over many days and don’t be in a hurry to get to the answer.

Doing that for ever larger squares (1 by 1, 2 by 2, 3 by 3, …) we get 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 5 = 6 (as pictured), 1 + 7 = 8, 1 + 9 = 10, and so on. So, all even numbers starting with 4 can be done this way."

        "block5_text": {
          "eng": "A powerful idea that wraps this up quickly is to see that we can take a diagram that works, and replace one of its squares by another diagram that works. So for example, if you take a simple 2 by 2 filled in with 4 1 by 1 squares, and you replace one of those 1 by 1 squares with the 6-square example, you get the diagram shown at right with 9 squares.\n\nBecause one square is getting replaced by an n-square diagram, the net change in the number of squares is to add n-1 of them. That means that we can take one number that works, and add multiples of one less than it to any other number that works. In particular, we can add multiples of 4 -1 = 3 to any other number that works - the easy ones to add 3 to are all the even numbers starting with 4. \n\nPutting that all together says that the numbers 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, … all work, and it is easy to see at least one simple way to construct them. It is also easy to convince yourself that 2, 3, and 5 are impossible.\n\nIf your child enjoys exploring that question, explore variations on this theme. Suppose you only allow squares of certain sizes - such as 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and 3 by 3. Or perhaps only allow 2 by 2 and 3 by 3. See which questions lead to interesting results and which ones are not so interesting.\n\nAnother direction to look at is filling other figures with figures that have the same shape. For example, ask the same question for regular triangles (triangles with all their sides the same length).

      "block1_text": "Suppose you have an 8 by 8 chessboard and you have a collection of 1 by 2 tiles. Finding a way to exactly cover the chessboard with 32 of these 1 by 2 tiles is simple enough. \n\nLet’s start removing some squares from the chessboard and see what happens. If you remove one corner of the chessboard, you know immediately that you can no longer cover the chessboard with tiles because the tiles will always cover an even number of squares, and there are now 63 squares to cover. Okay, remove two corners to make an even number of remaining squares - can you cover it now? The answer depends on which two corners you remove. Why? What if you no longer restrict yourself to removing corners, what will happen then?",
      "block2_title": "Analysis",
      "block2_text": "Let your child play with this before revealing the coloring idea. If they play around with small boards, they may discover the rule on their own, and that is always better.\n\nAn observation that helps a lot with this question is to use the coloring of the chessboard squares. If you take the 1 by 2 tiles and color one square white and the other black, you will see an interesting thing occur. Every tile must cover a square of each color. Not only will k tiles cover 2xk squares, but they will cover k white squares and k black squares - the same number of squares of each color. Using this idea, it becomes obvious that if you remove more squares of one color than another, it will be impossible to cover the board. \n\nIf your child is enjoying these questions, start branching out to using other shapes to fill the board. Play around with filling it with 1 by 3 tiles or with 3 squares in an L shape. What patterns and rules do you discover with these? What other shapes might be interesting to play with?",
      "block3_title": "Filling Squares With Squares - Introduction",
      "block3_text": "In which ways can you fill a square with other squares, where the other squares need not all be the same size? However, the lengths cannot be totally random numbers – the side length of each square must be some whole number multiple of a fixed length. The question to investigate is: What are all the numbers of squares that are possible? Also, if you know a number is possible, is there an easy way to describe how to do it?\n\nLet your child play with it over many days and don’t be in a hurry to get to the answer. There are many different ways to come up with ideas for this investigation, so be flexible and work with your child’s ideas. Here is a diagram showing how 6 is possible.",
      "block4_title": "Analysis",
      "block4_text": "Coming up with some quick examples is always a good idea. Breaking the big square into squares of equal size as an easy start. From that you know that the square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …) all work. \n\nWorking off the 6 square example, we can use one large square of any size and put 1 by 1 squares on two of its sides. Doing that for ever larger squares (1 by 1, 2 by 2, 3 by 3, …) we get 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 5 = 6 (as pictured), 1 + 7 = 8, 1 + 9 = 10, and so on. So, all even numbers starting with 4 can be done this way.",
      "block5_text": "A powerful idea that wraps this up quickly is to see that we can take a diagram that works, and replace one of its squares by another diagram that works. So for example, if you take a simple 2 by 2 filled in with 4 1 by 1 squares, and you replace one of those 1 by 1 squares with the 6-square example, you get the diagram shown at right with 9 squares.\n\nBecause one square is getting replaced by an n-square diagram, the net change in the number of squares is to add n-1 of them. That means that we can take one number that works, and add multiples of one less than it to any other number that works. In particular, we can add multiples of 4 -1 = 3 to any other number that works - the easy ones to add 3 to are all the even numbers starting with 4. \n\nPutting that all together says that the numbers 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, … all work, and it is easy to see at least one simple way to construct them. It is also easy to convince yourself that 2, 3, and 5 are impossible.\n\nIf your child enjoys exploring that question, explore variations on this theme. Suppose you only allow squares of certain sizes - such as 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and 3 by 3. Or perhaps only allow 2 by 2 and 3 by 3. See which questions lead to interesting results and which ones are not so interesting.\n\nAnother direction to look at is filling other figures with figures that have the same shape. For example, ask the same question for regular triangles (triangles with all their sides the same length). Some figures are interesting to investigate in this way, and some are not interesting at all - which ones?"
