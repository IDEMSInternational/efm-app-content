Leave the fold in place and cut along the line marked C.\n\nTake the triangle produced and fold it in half so that sides AB and C overlap.\n\nPut a temporary fold in this triangle and use the fold to mark the middle of side ABC. Undo the temporary fold.\n\nMake a fold over F. When you fold over F, you will be looking to have G placed so that G breaks the angle in half. \n\nFold along G - do this fold underneath so that this new folded piece is underneath the other paper.\n\nAlthough not strictly necessary, it is a good idea to slice off the top of this figure. Otherwise, you might be tempted to use the region above the red dotted line without realizing that there isn’t paper on all levels.\n\nLastly, fold this triangle in half.

Though it takes a few steps, don’t be put off by them - with a little practice they become quick and easy. \n\nStart by taking a standard sheet of paper and folding at one of the corners so the sides marked A and B meet. Leave the fold in place and cut along the line marked C.\n\nTake the triangle produced and fold it in half so that sides AB and C overlap.\n\nPut a temporary fold in this triangle and use the fold to mark the middle of side ABC. Undo the temporary fold.\n\nMake a fold over F. When you fold over F, you will be looking to have G placed so that G breaks the angle in half. \n\nFold along G - do this fold underneath so that this new folded piece is underneath the other paper.\n\nAlthough not strictly necessary, it is a good idea to slice off the top of this figure. Otherwise, you might be tempted to use the region above the red dotted line without realizing that there isn’t paper on all levels.\n\nLastly, fold this triangle in half. At last you are all set to do the cutting of your design!\n\nHave fun experimenting with many different combinations of cuts and colors!"

Despite that simple goal, you may start to wonder about deeper ideas in the puzzle.\n\nA frequent theme of problem solving is to learn from simpler problems or examples. So, let’s do that.\n\nThe smallest example is 2 by 2. For this size, it is clear that the rows will end up being either 1 2; 3 0 or 1 3; 2 0.\n\nThe next smallest is 2 by 3. Start this by getting the 1 and 4 in the left column. Once this is done, your puzzle will look like 1 _ _; 4 _ _ . Finish off the last four squares as you would the 2 by 2 case.\n\nThe 2 by 4 puzzle is done similarly. Start by putting 1 and 5 in the left column. Next, put the 2 and 6 in the second left column without disturbing the 1 and 4. Finally finish off the last 2 by 2.\n\nAt this point, the pattern for attacking puzzles with 2 rows is clear. What to do with more than 2 rows? Suppose you have 3 rows. Start the solution by getting the top row correctly laid out. After that, leave the top row undisturbed and use your ability to solve a puzzle with 2 rows.\n\nSimilarly, if there are 4 rows, do the top row first, the second row next (without disturbing the top row), and finish off the last 2 rows as before."

          "eng": "Okay, you have a simple method for solving the puzzle. The next question is: How can I just look at the puzzle and know whether it is solvable or not?\n\nTo make describing the answer as simple as possible, do a few quick moves, if needed, to place the empty square in the bottom row. Next, make a list of the rows in one long list - the first row is listed first, the second row is listed second, and so on with the last row listed last. Omit the empty square when you list the last row.\n\nTake this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n\nAs an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n\nWhy does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions."

However, if all the numbers are all odd numbers or all even numbers, then the sums are all even.

For example, if you have 3 Evens and 1 Odd you get the same results as 1 Even and 3 odds.

Once you’ve seen these numbers, a good question for an older child is: why wouldn’t you just put all your tokens on 1? To see the answer to this, imagine the simpler situation where you had only two tokens and you ignored all results that weren’t 1 or 2. Then 1 would happen 10 / 18 of the time and 2 would happen 8 / 18 of the time. If you put both tokens on 1, you would need to get a 1 and then a 1 to win after two rolls.

Ignoring mirror images will reduce the number of solutions to consider by half. \n\nFor example, we can assume that not only is the 6 in the bottom row, but it is either in the middle or the right side of the bottom row. Continuing that thinking with the 5, the bottom row can only have four possible layouts: 5 a 6, b 5 6, c 1 6, or d 6 1.\n\nAt this point it is a matter of working through the various possible values of a, b, c, and d.

The 6 must be in the bottom row because it cannot be the difference of any pair of numbers. Similarly, the 5 must either be in the bottom row or in the middle row above the 6 and the 1.",

      "block2_text": "If your child finds this puzzle easy to do, challenge them to find all the ways it can be done. Discuss what it means for two solutions to be different - if one solution is the mirror image of another, should it be considered different?\n\nAnswering the question of what makes solutions different is useful to do at the start. Because the mirror image of any solution is easy to make and is also a solution, it makes sense to ignore those. Ignoring mirror images will reduce the number of solutions to consider by half. \n\nFor example, we can assume that not only is the 6 in the bottom row, but it is either in the middle or the right side of the bottom row. Continuing that thinking with the 5, the bottom row can only have four possible layouts: 5 a 6, b 5 6, c 1 6, or d 6 1.\n\nAt this point it is a matter of working through the various possible values of a, b, c, and d. After some trial and error you will find that a is 2, b can never work, c must be 4, and d must be 4. So, ignoring mirror images, there are exactly three solutions:",

This involves two challenges - finding out which sums will work and then figuring out how to get those sums. It is better to let your child play with this to figure out which sums are possible, but if frustration wins out, the possible sums are 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nIf your child enjoys figuring this out, this can be done for larger triangles as well. For a triangle with nine circles with four circles on a side, the possible sums are 17, 19, 20, 21, and 23.\n\nAs with so many of the puzzles for this age group, the main reason to have your child play with this is to encourage having fun exploring how numbers interact with each other and to practice number facts. They do not yet have the math or reasoning skills to be systematic with their exploration. However, these puzzles can be explored more deeply, and here are some ideas to dig into if you or an older child are interested.\n\nLet SUM represent the sum of one side of the triangle. If you add up the three sides of the triangle, the total will be 3 x SUM. However, the total of the three sides will also be the sum of all the numbers plus one extra copy for each corner of the triangle. Let C-SUM be the sum of the values in the three corners. We end up with the relationship that 3 x SUM = (Total of all the numbers) + C-SUM."

        "block2_text": {
          "eng": "Apply this to the triangle with six circles. The sum of all the numbers is the sum of the numbers from one to six, which is 21. So the equation becomes 3 x SUM = 21 + C-SUM The smallest C-SUM can be is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the largest it can be is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. So, 3 x SUM is between 21 + 6 = 27 and 21 + 15 = 36. This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n\nAnother thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values. What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n\nThe last thing to notice before we dig in with actual numbers is that for any solution for the three corners, we can assume that they are in increasing order going around clockwise, with the smallest number at the top. If they are not in that configuration to begin with, you can rotate or flip the diagram until they are.\n\nAll these observations save a tremendous amount of work. We only need to look at SUM equal to 9 and 10, and we only need to have the corners in increasing order. If SUM is 9, then C-SUM = 3 x 9 - 21 = 6, so the trio is 1, 2, and 3. If SUM is 10, then a + b + c = 3 x 10 - 21 = 9. This leaves two possibilities - either corner values of 1, 2, and 6, or 1, 3, and 5. A quick trial rules out 1, 2, and 6 as a possibility.\n\nAfter much work, we have the solutions for SUM being 9 and 10 for the six circle puzzle. Remember that you can get the solutions for SUM being 11 and 12 by subtracting all the entries from 7."

      "block1_text": "Make a triangle of six circles with three circles on a side. In the circles, use each of the numbers from 1 to 6 once so that each side of the triangle has the same sum. This involves two challenges - finding out which sums will work and then figuring out how to get those sums. It is better to let your child play with this to figure out which sums are possible, but if frustration wins out, the possible sums are 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nIf your child enjoys figuring this out, this can be done for larger triangles as well. For a triangle with nine circles with four circles on a side, the possible sums are 17, 19, 20, 21, and 23.\n\nAs with so many of the puzzles for this age group, the main reason to have your child play with this is to encourage having fun exploring how numbers interact with each other and to practice number facts. They do not yet have the math or reasoning skills to be systematic with their exploration. However, these puzzles can be explored more deeply, and here are some ideas to dig into if you or an older child are interested.\n\nLet SUM represent the sum of one side of the triangle. If you add up the three sides of the triangle, the total will be 3 x SUM. However, the total of the three sides will also be the sum of all the numbers plus one extra copy for each corner of the triangle. Let C-SUM be the sum of the values in the three corners. We end up with the relationship that 3 x SUM = (Total of all the numbers) + C-SUM.",
      "block2_title": "6-Circle Puzzle",
      "block2_text": "Apply this to the triangle with six circles. The sum of all the numbers is the sum of the numbers from one to six, which is 21. So the equation becomes 3 x SUM = 21 + C-SUM The smallest C-SUM can be is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the largest it can be is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. So, 3 x SUM is between 21 + 6 = 27 and 21 + 15 = 36. This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n\nAnother thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values. What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n\nThe last thing to notice before we dig in with actual numbers is that for any solution for the three corners, we can assume that they are in increasing order going around clockwise, with the smallest number at the top. If they are not in that configuration to begin with, you can rotate or flip the diagram until they are.\n\nAll these observations save a tremendous amount of work. We only need to look at SUM equal to 9 and 10, and we only need to have the corners in increasing order. If SUM is 9, then C-SUM = 3 x 9 - 21 = 6, so the trio is 1, 2, and 3. If SUM is 10, then a + b + c = 3 x 10 - 21 = 9. This leaves two possibilities - either corner values of 1, 2, and 6, or 1, 3, and 5. A quick trial rules out 1, 2, and 6 as a possibility.\n\nAfter much work, we have the solutions for SUM being 9 and 10 for the six circle puzzle. Remember that you can get the solutions for SUM being 11 and 12 by subtracting all the entries from 7.",
      "block3_title": "9-Circle Puzzle",

For example, 32 petals is four 7’s and one 4, and it is also eight 4’s.\n\nBy trying many pairs of numbers, there are lots of examples to play with.

If your child wants to go up some steps, a natural question is: How many ways can this be done?\nFor example, for 0 steps there is just one way - you just stand there. For 1 step there is one way - you take a single step. For two steps, you can either take one double step or two single steps. \n\nYour child should carefully count many cases of this and make a table of the results. When there is lots of information, a table often helps organize the information and allow patterns to stand out. The table would look like this (okay, going beyond 6 may require too much patience, but here are the numbers):\n\n1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 21 - 34 - 55\n\nAfter looking at these numbers, your child may notice that each pair of consecutive numbers adds up to the next number. Why does this happen? These numbers are called Fibonacci Numbers. The rule for creating the official Fibonacci Numbers is that each number is the sum of the previous two. This also happens for the steps. Hmmm ...\n\nLet’s look closely at one example - say 5 steps. The 8 possibilities are: 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 2+2+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+2+2, and 2+1+2. The first 5 possibilities use 1 for the last move, and the last 3 possibilities use 2 for the last move. That explains it - you can go up 5 steps by either going up 4 steps and taking 1 more step, or by going up 3 steps and going up 2 more steps. The number of ways of going up 5 steps is exactly equal to the sum of the number of ways of going up 4 steps plus the number of ways of going up 3 steps.\n\nPatterns are often understood by patiently going through examples, organizing the data, looking closely at the data, and digging for explanations of why things happen the way they do.

The scale is usually supplied with a set of weights that are used to measure the weight of other objects. There are many interesting investigations you can do if you restrict the weights you are allowed to use.\n\n**One Kind of Weight** Suppose you have lots of weights, but they are all the same - say, 5 units. Then the only things you can weigh exactly are objects that are a multiple of 5 (just like skip counting by 5).\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - One Side** Suppose you have lots of weights that are either 4 units or 7 units and you only use them on one side of the balance. The things you can weigh are the same numbers you found in the flower petal investigation. For 4 and 7, starting at 18 units you can weigh everything exactly. If the weights are 4 units and 6 units, you can only weigh even numbers starting with 4.\n\n**Two Kinds of Weights - Both Sides** After doing the investigation with two kinds of weights on one side, your child might be surprised if you ask them to weigh a 3-unit item, or even a 1-unit item, with 4’s and 7’s. The trick is to put some weights on one side and other weights on the other side. For example, verify an item weighs 3 units by putting it with a 4-unit weight and see that it balances with a 7-unit weight. Similarly, verify an item weighs 1 unit by putting it with a 7-unit weight and see that it balances with two 4-unit weights.\n\nThere is an important math theorem called Bezout’s Theorem hidden in this investigation. Your child doesn’t need to know about that theorem at this point, but isn’t it cool that a young child can be playing around with advanced mathematics!\n\n**Doubling Weights** What happens if you have one weight each for each of the weights in the doubling progression 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16? How many ways can you weigh something that weighs 13? What is the largest weight you can measure? \n\nAfter some investigation, you will find that you can weigh everything up to one less than double the highest weight - in this case that is 31. Also, each item you can weigh can only be weighed in one way - for example, 13 = 1 + 4 + 8, and there is no other way to do it. Pretty cool! This situation is related to the binary number system.\n\nFibonacci Weights: What happens if the weights are in the Fibonacci Numbers? Is there more than one way to weigh some weights? Find a restriction that would cause there to be only one way for each weight.\n\nSuppose you have one each for the weights 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13. With this, 10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 + 8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 1 + 8. What is causing the duplication is that the Fibonacci rule creates more than one way to write the Fibonacci numbers in terms of themselves - for example, 2 = 1 + 1 and 8 = 5 + 3. The way to fix this problem is to insist that you cannot use two Fibonacci numbers that are neighbors of each other in the sequence. When you add that restriction, the only way to get 10 is 2 + 8."

See if your child can come up with some of these questions - however, if they don’t arise naturally, here are some questions to ask.\n\na) Why are the numbers that drop down primes?\n\nSuppose you have a composite number. We want to show that this number will have an X under it. Being composite, it is divisible by some number, n, between 1 and that number. If n is a prime, then our composite number would have an X under it from n being an earlier prime. If n is not a prime, then it has an X under it from some earlier prime, call it p. Now, p evenly divides n and n evenly divides our new number, so p must divide our new number. Consequently, when marking the multiples of p, an X would have been placed under our new number.\n\nb) When you are placing X’s for the multiples of a prime, there are some numbers that already have an X from an earlier prime. When does that happen and when doesn’t it happen?\n\nLet’s look at the multiples of 5 in the sieve above. The multiples 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are already crossed out. Only 5 x 5 is new. This happens because 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are all multiples of 2 and 3, earlier primes. If we want to put X’s in fresh places, we must multiply 5 by numbers that only have prime factors that are 5 and above. Because it is a little tedious to keep track of all that, what some people do is only cross out odd multiples and leave it at that.\n\nc) For this sieve, what was the last prime that had a useful new X in its row?\n\nIn this sieve, the primes with useful X’s are 2, 3, and 5. The multiples of 7 and 11 were all old X’s. If you look at the answer to the last question, you will see the answer here. The only way to get new X’s is to multiply a prime by primes bigger than or equal to itself. Once we reach a prime like 7 where 7 x 7 > 25, we do not need to check it. So, we only need to check primes whose square is smaller than or equal to the last number.\n\nd) If you were given a number, say 53, which primes would you need to divide it by to see that it is prime? \n\nFrom the answer to the last question, we only need to check primes whose square is less than or equal to 53. Those primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7 – none of these divides 53 evenly, so 53 must be prime!"

This is a mathematical process to instill in your child – look for patterns and then seek to understand them, and with that new understanding extend your earlier results.\n\nWhat is going on is that the bounces on a table do not change if you enlarge both dimensions by the same factor.

It might not occur to you, but once you see it you will probably be amazed. The idea is to unfold the table so that the ball can go in a straight line!

Playing with more examples leads to some more patterns.\n\n**Result** If n is not a multiple of 3, a 3 by n table has n+1 bounces and ends in the upper right corner if n has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and in the lower right corner if n has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. If n is odd, a 4 by n table has n + 2 bounces and ends in the upper left corner. If n is not a multiple of 5, a 5 by n table has n+3 bounces and ends up in the upper right corner when n is odd and lower right corner when n is even.\n\nAt this point we are tempted to look over the data, see some patterns, and make some conjectures.",
      "block3_title": "Conjecture",
      "block3_text": "Assume k and n have no factors in common. Then a k by n table will have k + n - 2 bounces. It will end in the upper left corner if k is even. It will end in the upper right corner if k is odd and n is odd, and in the lower right corner if k is odd and n is even.\n\nWow - if this conjecture is true, we have completely solved this problem! You know what’s coming… Let’s see if we can explain why this conjecture should be true (or find out that it is false). \n\nAlthough there are other ways to understand this situation, as sometimes happens, what makes this problem much easier to understand is a new idea. It might not occur to you, but once you see it you will probably be amazed. The idea is to unfold the table so that the ball can go in a straight line! Here is what happens if we unfold the original 3 by 4 table and make the path of the ball into a straight line.",
      "block4_text": "Seeing that the conjecture is true is a lot easier now. The bounces correspond to crossing lines - there are (k - 1) of them to cross in one direction and (n - 1) of them to cross in the other direction, so together that makes a total of (k - 1) + (n - 1) = k + n - 2 lines to cross. Seeing which corner it ends up in is a matter of keeping track of how things unfold. We’re all done now with quite an interesting journey."
