How many balls are there? \n**Level 2** Ask general or open questions about this point in the story. What do you see happening here? What is this group of things? \n**Level 3** Ask about the story line. What has happened? What will happen next? Have you had experiences or seen things similar to this? How does she feel when this happens?"
